            <title>Two books of Mr Sydrach Simpson, late master of Pembroke-Hall in Cambridg; and preacher of the Gospel in London. Viz. I. Of unbelief; or the want of readiness to lay hold on the comfort given by Christ. II. Not going to Christ for life and salvation is an exceeding great sin, yet it is pardonable. In the first book is shewed (besides many other things) 1 What unbelief it is that is here spoken of ... 7 Helps to attain readiness in beleeving. In the second book is shewed, 1 That unbelief is a great sin, and exceeding provoking unto God ... 7 God hath pardoned unbelief, and wil pardon it.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I confeſs that my love of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the following Treatiſe, and the Blesſing which the Lord of his goodneſs vouchſafed me by the ſame, Together with the leave which the Author (in his life time) oft gave me to Print any of his works that I had taken from him in writing, have ſtrongly inclined me (ſince his death) to publiſh ſome of them to the World: But did forbear, becauſe I knew that Sermons
<pb facs="tcp:159991:2"/>Preached by the moſt able Miniſter, may yet need and deſerve his peruſall, and ſome amendments before they be Printed: Yet at laſt am overcome to make them (as they are) publick, by the importunities of many that heard them preached, having this Confidence that you will remember that they are but Sermons Preached, and not prepared by the Author for the Preſs: And notwithſtanding that, I do beleeve, that if you read them ſeriouſly, ponderouſly, and with a ſpiritual heart, (whether you are Miniſters, or private Chriſtians) you wil find no cauſe of repenting of your pains, but rather wil be conſtrained to read them again &amp; again; for I ever found his Sermons wel ſtudied and digeſted, that the oftner I read them, the more I perceived in them. Give me leave only to inform you that the Author did preach above fourſcore Sermons upon that Text <hi>Eph. 13. To the Praiſe and Glory of his Grace,</hi> and upon Texts relating to and purſuing that matter of Arminianiſm, which he hath elaborate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled both Doctrinally and practically, many of the which I have wrote out, and am reſolved (as God gives ſtrength and time) to finiſh the reſt; yet I ſhal altogether omit the publiſhing of any of them, unleſs I underſtand that theſe find good acceptance.

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Scope of the Text. The Phraſe of Receiving Chriſt, opened. Receiving denotes,</hi> 1 <hi>Paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 2 <hi>A meanneſs of condition in the Receiver.</hi> 3 <hi>A taking that which before he had not.</hi> 4 <hi>A taking a thing with joy and gladneſs of heart. The Doctrine; Perſons that are Beleevers are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers; and to believe is to receive. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by three Arguments:</hi> 1. <hi>Faith is the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of the New Creature.</hi> 2. <hi>All other acts of Faith are ſubordinate to this of Receiving.</hi> 3. <hi>Nothing is done by Faith until ſuch time as it doth receive.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THeſe Words are an Argument to prove the Eternal God-head of eſus Chriſt, becauſe thoſe that do receive him, are made the Sons of God, and have ſuch a dignity and preheminence, or prerogative thereby, as none but

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:159991:5"/>God can beſtow. My intent in this Text is only to open the phraſe of receiving Chriſt, as it is Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and made all one with beleeving on him. As many as received him, As many as believed on his name have this power, to become the Sons of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt: In generall, Receiving notes paſſiveneſs, or being the ſubject of a thing. As cloth doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a color which is put upon it, and is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or proper to it. And as the Earth receives the ſeed that is put into it by the hand of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. There may be an act in receiving, yet Receiving doth principally note paſſiveneſs; becauſe that act is an order of nature, either after receiving, or elſe Receiving is the complement, or that unto which the ſame act tends. As a graft being put into a ſtock, the Stock cloſeth with the Graft by vertue from its ſelf: So we having the Grace of Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, we alſo do adhere and cleave unto God. Or as in receiving mony, there is an acounting of it, but that accounting of it ſerves only to take it into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. So it is here alſo. There is ſomthing the ſoul doth in receiving, but it tends only to this end that it may be poſſeſſed of Jeſus Chriſt and of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>Secondly: As there is a paſſiveneſs in Receiving to be noted; So in receiving there is a meanneſs and and lowneſs of condition. It was an Apotheg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e or uſuall ſpeech of our Lord (as it ſeems by the Apoſtle) To ſay. <hi>It is better to give than to receive</hi> Acts 20.35. That is better, more honorable, more commendable. He that gives the leaſt gift, hath more honor than he that receives the greateſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And as I ſhall ſhew you afterward. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the profit of beleeving, it is very great, but in regard of the manner of beleeving it is an abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:159991:5"/>unto man, A denial even of his reaſon for the teſtimony ſake of Chriſt. But thoſe are not the things which I intend principally.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: in Receiving there is a taking to ones ſelf that which before he had not. As a man receives mony which before was out of his hands; by being received it comes into his poſſeſſion, and is his own. And in this ſenſe you ſhal find the word <hi>[Received]</hi> uſed in the Scripture in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.39. <hi>All theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained their good report through Faith, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not the promiſe.</hi> Received it not, that is, they ſaw not: they were not made actually partakers of the benefits of Chriſt being in the fleſh; Although that they had the advantage and profit of his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for them with the Father: They Received it not, that is, they were not actually partakers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Receiving notes the taking a thing with joy and gladneſs of heart. As the Text ſaith, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.2. <hi>There was ſome that did receive Angels unawares.</hi> It being (you know) a phraſe that is taken from thoſe men that do bid welcome their gueſts or friends.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59.</note> And ſo <hi>Stephen</hi> prays in that language, Lord Jeſus (ſaith he) receive my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. He doth by his faith apprehend Jeſus Chriſt ſtanding in the door of Heaven (as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood in the door of the Tent) and praies him to be pleaſed and not paſs him by, but to receive him that he may ſit down and eat and drink in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe two latter things are thoſe which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally I intend to ſpeak unto in this point. And if you look into the words of my Text, you ſhal find.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the perſons that are Receivers are Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>For as many</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>as received him, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159991:6"/>them he gave power to become the Sons of God, even to as many as beleeve on his name.</hi> All they that received him, beleeved on him, and all they that beleeved, received Chriſt: They, and none elſe. They are the ſame perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct </seg>
                  </label> Secondly, you may obſerve (which is the main thing I intend) that Beleevers and Receivers are not only one and the ſame perſons: <hi>But to beleeve is to receive, and to receive Chriſt is beleeve on his name.</hi> What in the beginning of the Text is called receiving of him, in the end of the Text is called beleeving on his name, the ſame perſons in the ſame act that in the beginning of the verſe are ſaid to receive, are in the latter end of the verſe ſaid to beleeve on his name. They muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be but divers expreſſions of the ſame Act, for this reaſon: Becauſe otherwiſe, if you make them two diſtinct acts, a man may receive Chriſt, and yet not beleeve, and a man may beleeve on Chriſt, &amp; yet not receive him. It is impoſſible that Chriſt ſhould be received but by Faith, and it is impoſſible a man ſhould beleeve on the name of Chriſt, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. The manner of ſpeech is ſuppoſed to be a Caldeiſme, or a propriety among the Caldees, who make it all one to beleeve and to truſt. And upon this now ſhall I faſten a little while.</p>
               <p>Faith, I ſay, it is a receiving of Chriſt. As many as received him. There is ſomthing to be received for beleeving. In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Receiving the end of your Faith, the ſalvation of your Souls.</hi> A man ſhal be ſaved for his faith, as well as rewarded for his ſufferings or any other act of obedience and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance unto God, a man ſhal be as well rewarded at the laſt becauſe he hath much of God, as becauſe he hath done much for God, indeed he doth moſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:159991:6"/>for God, that receivs moſt from God. He that goes on truſt with Chriſt, and receivs any thing of him, ſhall be rewarded for his receiving, rewarded for his gain and for his getting. <hi>Of his fulneſs have we received Grace for Grace,</hi> John, 1.16. <hi>For Grace</hi> that is, becauſe we have one Grace, we ſhall have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother until we come to be full. That word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, tranſlated <hi>[for]</hi> is as much in the Scripture, as <hi>[Becauſe]</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.31. <hi>For this cauſe</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſhall a man leave his Father and Mother and ſhall be joyned unto his Wife.</hi> The ſame word may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> Becauſe God hath given us one degree, he will give us another: Becauſe he hath ſhewed us one kindneſs, he will with-hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is good from us. Among men, he that takes upon truſt, binds himſelf to make return and to pay again: But he that truſts God makes God a Debtor to him. It may be that thou accounteſt it a preſumption, that thou beleeveſt; But God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts it ſervice: And of all ſervices it ſhall not be unrewarded, but have the fulleſt and largeſt meaſure, becauſe of all ſervices it is that which is moſt humbling and ſelf-denying of the Creature. But of that by the way.</p>
               <p>As there is a receiving ſomthing for beleeving, ſo there is a receiving in beleeving. Faith it ſelf is a receiving, as eating is a taking of what may nouriſh: And buying or poſſeſſion is a receiving an inheritance. So you ſhall find that Faith is compared in <hi>John</hi> 6.53. to eating and drinking. And to buying in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 55.1. Somtimes its an hand that laies hold, and wil not let go the thing which it hath; and to the being poſſeſſed of an inheritance. Chriſt receives all from the Father, and Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all from Chriſt. All comes from the Father into Chriſt as into a Fountain, and Faith fetchech all from that Fountain into us as into leſſer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:159991:7"/>meaſures or ciſterns. Jeſus Chriſt is the Treaſury and Faith tels out of him what the Soul hath need of; as Chriſt is made between us and God, ſo faith is given to this end that Chriſt may be made what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is unto us. That the thing I aim at may yet be more fully and plainly known to you.</p>
               <p>Faith indeed in the Scripture is ſomtimes expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Working</hi> but the Text ſaith, <hi>It works by love. Gal.</hi> 5.6. that is, It doth ſet love on a flame and makes a man to have an indeared eſteem of God, and an undervaluing of himſelf, and every thing which he hath for his ſake. Faith doth work, but it is by the hand of love. But now look on Faith in it ſelf, And ſo its a receiving. I ſay it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. Its a having and craving grace, which will alwaies be getting and wil never have enough. When it is filled, it is hungry, and like the barren Womb, and the earth, and the grave, it ſtil cries, Give, Give. And for this you ſhall find the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture very cleer. <hi>John</hi> 1.11. <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not,</hi> that is, they did not apply him unto themſelves as the author of their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Meſſiah which was promiſed. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. the Apoſtle cals beleeving, <hi>the receiving of the Grace of God.</hi> When he would ſet forth the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that is in men naturally, he ſaith, <hi>the naturall man receives not the things of God,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>As you have received Chriſt Jeſus, ſo walk in him. Col.</hi> 2.6. that is, anſwer your Faith with works, let your life be anſwerable to your hopes, and to the ſtate you are brought into by beleeving. I may quote many other expreſſions to ſhew that Faith is a receiving. But theſe ſhall ſerve. I wil only give a three fold Argument or Demonſtration of it.</p>
               <p>Friſt, All that have Faith in any degree, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:159991:7"/>and longings after Jeſus Chriſt, and the things of him. Faith its an appetite in the new Creature whereby it craves and hungers after Jeſus Chriſt and his benefits, and therefore you ſhall find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that Faith and praying unto God or deſiring after him are made all one. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11, 12, 13. In verſe 11. the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Whoever beleeveth on him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> For marke it, <hi>There is no difference between the Jew and the Gentile, for the ſame Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whoſoever ſhal call upon the name of the Lord ſhall beſaved.</hi> I ſay if you compare verſe 11. with ver. 12 and 13. Faith and calling on the name of the Lord are al one. For the Apoſtle proves that there is no man that doth beleeve, but he ſhal be ſaved, by this; That there is no man that cals on the name of the Lord but he ſhall be ſaved. Thoſe that have attained unto the greateſt degrees of Faith their mouths are fulleſt of complaints, &amp; their Souls ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of ſighings becauſe of their wants. Their praiers are Lord increaſe out Faith. And not only ſo,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5</note> but when they have prayed, they cannot be quiet until ſuch time as they find it encreaſed and the fruits of it in them. In <hi>Acts,</hi> 26.7. it's ſaid that the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs hoping to come to Heaven, did inſtantly ſerve God: That word tranſlated <hi>Inſtantly,</hi> is in the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, they did as one doth who ſtretches out himſelf to get a thing which he hath much ado to lay hold on, but had rather have, than any thing that he hath in his hands. Such a kind of deſire was in the Patriarchs after Glory. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. the Apoſtle tells you of an earneſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in the Creation for the manifeſtation of the Sons of God, that they may be freed from their imperfections, and be like their Head Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth that he deſires to be with Chriſt Jeſus; that is, he profeſſeth it as one that muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:159991:8"/>have his mind, or muſt die. Thoſe that have the leaſt degree of Faith, are alwaies craving after Jeſus Chriſt; they are never well but when they are receiving. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. is ſaid to pray; Go (ſaith God to <hi>Ananias</hi>) unto <hi>Paul, Behold he prayes.</hi> He did other things beſides prayer; he was ſenſible of his ſin, and afflicted in his conſcience for going againſt Jeſus Chriſt; but the Text men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions nothing but this, That <hi>he praies;</hi> becauſe that was it that al the bitterneſs of ſin was a means unto, and that which he was eminent in. And all that <hi>Paul</hi> deſired was, That God would give him Chriſt although he had done what he could to crucifie him again in his members. As the love of the world makes a man to be ſcraping and gathering together by any means, although it be never ſo vile. It's no matter what the thing be, ſo it brings in gain to a worldly man. So it is the proper work of Faith to make a man look for Jeſus Chriſt in all Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Duties. That is the penny which it ſweeps the houſe for, and ſearcheth every duty for. Now this deſire, it comes from Faith. For what makes any man deſire, but hope, and the knowledge of the excellency of the things hoped for: Both which comes through believing. That is the firſt thing. All that have Faith deſire to receive Jeſus Chriſt and his benefits, and therefore the Act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving is the principal act of Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All other Acts of Faith are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to this Act of receiving, and done in reference to receiying. You have heard that Faith hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Acts. It takes Gods word, and receives his Teſtimony, even when it fees no reaſon to expound the thing that is ſpoken of; but the End is, that it may receive. I know whom I have truſted, and that he is able at that day to give unto me what I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:159991:8"/>have committed to him. As a man takes the word of a man to this end, that he may be ſure not to miſs what is due to him: So this man takes the word of God and the Teſtimony of God only in order to be made a receiver of the things promiſed. Faith that doth unite, Chriſt dwels in our hearts by faith, but that very act of union is to this end, that ſo all Chriſt may be ours, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. We do but touch him, that ſo vertue may come out from him into us. Faith makes a man dependant and hanging upon God, but it is only that ſo a man may ingage the Lord to give, and he may receive. As a man comes to one and ſaith, I will truſt to you for ſuch a debt at ſuch a time, that ſo he may ſee that he doth not only expect it, but that he doth him double injury if he doth not give it him. Faith attracts and draws, but that is only that the ſoul may receive. That is the ſecond Reaſon. Faith is a receiving Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe al the Acts and Operations of it are in order to receiving.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,: Until this act of Faith be done, Faith can do nothing. Nothing can be done by Faith untill ſuch time as it doth receive. Faith purifies the heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. It makes the whol converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lively. <hi>We do live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. It makes a man overcome the world, and all the corruptions that are in the world and the evill one to boot, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 5.4. <hi>This is the victory wherby ye overcome the world, even your faith.</hi> He that is born of God overcomes the wicked one. But mark it, As water is firſt put into the Ciſtern before it flows forth, And as the earth firſt receives the ſeed before it brings forth meat for him by whom it is dreſſed: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7. And as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplesare firſt bid to attend the Paſſover, and then to receive the Holy Ghoſt, and then to go abroad and to diſtribute unto the Nations the knowledge
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:159991:9"/>of Chriſt: So Faith firſt receives from Chriſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it receives from him, So it ſtirs up every Grace and Faculty to its work. I ſay Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives firſt, In <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6. <hi>As ye have received the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo walk in him.</hi> As, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to our receiving of Chriſt. <hi>We beleeve, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we ſpoken,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. Now that which is ſaid concerning faiths opening the mouths of the Apoſtles to declare for certain the truth of that Doctrine which they were experienced in: So I may ſay concerning any other Duty. When as Faith hath received the certainty of the word of God, then it cals upon the underſtanding not to diſpute. When as Faith hath received Jeſus Chriſt then it cals upon the will, and ſaith, forſake all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things and cleave unto him, for you have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in him; He is a Mine and a Field wherein there is a Treaſure, and you ſhal need nothing while you have him. And from this three-fold Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, I ſuppoſe it will appear that Faith is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. And beloved, think not much that I ſtand long upon this for it is not rivited in our thoughts. We live not as if it were ſo.</p>

               <p>BEleeve then this is the principal uſe of Faith, To Receive, to be like a Bucket to draw water of life, and ſalvation out of the Well; A ſpunge (as I may expreſsit) to ſuck in and draw of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt. That Faith is beſt which is moſt receptive. That is the thing I do intend. That is beſt uſ'd w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is uſ'd to this end, to receive. The excelency
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:159991:9"/>of Faith doth not lie in it ſelf, but in its object: In what it doth bring in: For there is more vertue in the Act of any Grace whatever. He that knows a thing, doth it becauſe of the evidence of reaſon. But he that beleeveth, knows it not, Only he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievs becauſe he thinks that he that ſpeaks, ſpeaks true. Faith degrades a man from the uſe of his reaſon, and makes him although far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in his knowledg, yet to ſee in the light of God. It is ſo, becauſe he ſaith ſo. As a man that hath but little ſtock, but hath goods coming in by his trade, Such a trade is Faith. It's a weak and a feeble Grace (as I may call it) of it ſelf, but it is that which doth receive and fetch in much from Jeſus Chriſt. As the way of ſome mans living is not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing he hath of his own, but he is a Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſome noble and great man, and all his rents and Eſtate paſſeth through his hands, and ſo he comes to have a feeling of it, and to be inriched. Through the hand of Faith al the Treaſury of grace and mercy cometh, Do not therefore my beloved think it enough that you do by Faith ſecure your ſelves from the fear of Hell, and ſay I do beleeve and therefore I ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting life, Do not think it enough that by Faith you order your converſation aright; (for although it be true that no grace makes cleaner work in a mans conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation than Faith doth, it purifies even as God is pure, of all that Niter and Soap which God hath given to waſh in, there is none ſo ſcouring as Faith is, if I may uſe that expreſſion, it will fetch out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſpot and any defilement) But although Faith be of excellent uſe to order a mans converſation yet do not think you have made ſufficient uſe of your Faith when you have uſed it to that end, but uſe it to receive. As the uſe of a purſe is to put money in, And the uſe of an Iron Cheſt is to lodge
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:159991:10"/>money in, So the end of Faith is to receive. You are often times checking your ſelves, that you are not contented with what you have, for you have more than you deſerve, And that is true, But it is not more than you ought to receive. For Faith muſt have its perfect work, and its perfect work is this, that it doth look upon all Ordinances as bags that are filled, out of which it's to receive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as Jeſus Chriſt hath laid up and treaſured up of himſelf in them. After every duty enquire ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what thy Faith hath gotten, how thy talent of Faith hath gained. Be not contented that thou haſt the ſame confidence that thou hadſt, thou muſt either have more confidence, or further of the ſpirit of Chriſt by that confidence. Before thou doſt go to any Duty or to any Ordinance, charge thy ſelf as the Maſter or Merchant doth charge his Servant that goes out to receive money Go to ſuch a place and receive and return not elſe, Importune and be not ſatisfied with any anſwer untill you have received ſuch a ſum. As men are loſt in the world, and are of little uſe, they are in vain, but ciphers, becauſe they are not put to that work to which their Genius and diſpoſition tends: One man is made a Preacher that is much fitter for another calling, And another goes into the world that is fitter for another politick imployment. The World is out of order, becauſe men are not put to that uſe which God hath fitted men for. So the Grace of Faith is out of order and of little uſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not put to its proper work, viz. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Put your Faith to that and you will thrive, and not otherwiſe. <hi>They profited not, becauſe they did not mix the word with Faith,</hi> Heb. 4.2. And what is ſaid of hearing the word, may be ſaid of Praying, or receiving the Lords Supper, Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any other Ordinance whatſoever. They
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:159991:10"/>profited not: That is, they got no more becauſe it was not mixed with Faith. Things are ſaid to be mixed, not when they are one in another in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon veſſel, but when they are beaten together that they make but one body and ſubſtance. So Faith is mingled with the word, when there is not only a believing in the Groſs, and a taking for granted that that is true which is received, but when unto every word there goes an aſſent and a cloſing of heart unto every word. That is true ſaith the ſoul in ſuch a caſe. When as it hears the heart is deſperately wicked, and that none can go to the bottom of it, And when it hears by and by that concerning ſuch an heart that there is hope, the Soul ſaith that is true. When every thing is mingled with Faith then it profits. Let me I beſeech you (my beloved) ſpeak a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to you freely. Why do you ſuffer your Faith to be Idle? Why do you buſie it about works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath you, about that which is not moſt excellent and profitable? Do not think you have gotten e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough when by your Faith you have gotten into Chriſt, and Grace from him by Faith, for you are alwaies to be receiving. Many a man is apt to think it were well if he could keep what he hath gotten, if he can but hold his hold, and keep his union, and continue it under temptations, if he can but maintain his practice and hope &amp; not backſlide: But I beſeech you beloved conſider that al this is not enough, for you are to be receiving, not withſtanding that which you have received. And let me tel you this too, that if you are not receiving you are never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hold that which you have. As the waters in the ſtream would fail if there were not a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall flowing from the Wel-head and Fountain, So there muſt be a continual efflux and flowing and influence from Jeſus Chriſt that ſo the Grace you
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:159991:11"/>have may hold. In a Trade, he cannot keep open a Shop long that hath no comings in: And ſo it is certainly in the matters of Religion; If you pay uſe (for ſo you muſt do for all the opportunities and grace you have, they muſt be imployed) and you have no gain, it will undo you, although you began with the greateſt ſtock of reſolutions, and purpoſes, and deſires, and what you wil elſe. And therefore as you enquire into your ſelves, whether you have faith or not to prove whether you are a Beleever; So examine eſpecially thy Book, and ſee what thou canſt get by beleeving. Imploy thy faith therefore to this end, That you ſeek out what is promiſed, what God hath ſaid he will give; for he will give Grace and Glory, and with-hold no good thing from them that walk uprightly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. And ſend out Faith to get in all theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and challenge God upon his word continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſay, Lord, thou haſt ſaid this, and that, and a third thing, I have it under thy hand, it is written, <hi>Thou haſt ſpoken it, and haſt made me to beleeve in thee;</hi> and ſhall thy Word be as fleſh that ſhall fail and come to nothing? Imbolden thy heart, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the hand of thy Faith to receive; enlarge thy hand, and open thy mouth to take in much: and if thy Faith brings in any thing leſs than Jeſus Chriſt, it brings in nothing: For as it is in my Text, <hi>As many as received Him,
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.16.</note> were the Sons of God; and of His fulneſs we received Grace for Grace.</hi> If thou haſt any thing but Chriſt, thou haſt nothing: And if thou haſt any thing but from his heap, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and fulneſs, thou wilt not be enriched by it; thou haſt received but ſtraws and leaves for Gold and Jewels. I beſeech you my beloved, know, That as God hath given the eye to ſee, and the ear for hearing; ſo he hath given Faith to receive; on purpoſe to this end, That you may be continually
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:159991:11"/>taking in from his fulneſs. Faith is of a having and a craving nature and unſatisfied til a man hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the fulneſs he is ordained to in Chriſt; when it's filled, it is hungry: the more it hath the more it would have. Faith doth not only ſerve to keep you in a ſtate of Grace (for by Faith you ſtand) but to receive all Chriſts fulneſs which is laid up in him for you. Oh that we could beloved beleeve this, and live ſuch a kind of life; Such a kind of life of Faith is indeed Heaven upon Earth, when as a man is alwaies telling over treaſures for his own uſe and purpoſe. How joyful is the Merchant when the Ship comes home, and he is unlading the rich commodities which it is come fraighted with? How joyfull is the Husbandman when the harveſt comes, and renders an hundred fold for every corn? Such is the joy of God in the heart, and would be ſo if we did continually receive.</p>

               </p>
               <p>IN the ſecond place. If Faith be a receiving, then put out this Act. Excerciſe your Faith
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:159991:12"/>thus. As our Lord ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>Ask and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi> That is, not only deſire and pray, but take what you deſire and pray for from God: So I ſay, <hi>Believe and Receive.</hi> Beleeve not only that Faith is a receiving, but actually receive, and be ever getting. Every Grace is to have its perfect work, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks concerning patience, <hi>Let patience have its perfect work</hi> James 1.4. A Grace doth its perfect work when it ſerves all the turns for which it is given, when as it doth all the acts to which it hath power. Faith (as you heard in the explication) hath many other acts beſides receiving. Receiving is an act and work which Faith is as good at, and as good for as any other, the perfect and compleat work of Faith is to receive Chriſt. Set it therefore about it. Set it to reap al the Fruit of Jeſus Chriſt and of the promiſes. Set it as your Atturney (as I may ſo ſpeak) to cal in the debts you have and the good you hope for. Make Faith to be not only the evidence of what is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the Mountain that he ſtood upon to behold <hi>Canaan</hi>) <hi>but make it the ſubſtance of things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for,</hi> Heb. 11.1. That is, poſſeſſe your ſelves of the things beleeved and hoped for. Therefore as out of the Ark the Dove was ſent, and when ſhe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhe was ſent out again untill ſhe brought an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live branch in her mouth. So ſend out your Faith again and again, and never reſt till it hath received and gotten more from Chriſt than it had before, yea received according to the large gifts that are made through the promiſes. Plainly thus. As a man is to enquire of his Faith whether it be opeative or not, whatit doth, What work and fruit his Faith hath. So he is to enquire what his Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives what receipts it makes. It's not a good Faith which works not, and it's not a true Faith which receives not. Ask what the Lord hath done for thy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:159991:12"/>Soul? What promiſes are come in? What they have yeilded unto thee? What word is made good? What thou haſt gotten every day more than other? What thou haſt gotten by prayer or any other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And if thou doſt find that there is no coming in, blame thy Faith, and ſend it out to its work, ſend it out to receive from Jeſus Chriſt. That I may a little ſet you on upon this, or that you may underſtand what you are to do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Neglect not this for any other Act of Faith whatſoever. As our Lord ſaid in another caſe, Theſe things you ought to have done, but not to have left the other undone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.25. So I ſay, you ought by Faith to aſſent to the truth of what is promiſed, And you ought by Faith to keep your hold and union unto Jeſus Chriſt, but you ought as well to receive, and to get in what you have not yet. Intend this act of Faith more than al other acts, as that end to which all other acts of Faith ſerves, and which maintains all other Acts of Faith. Know that you are therefore to truſt and are to be united to Chriſt that you may receive from him, and be filled with his fulneſs. Be contented with no other kind of receiving through Faith than what may be able to maintain all other acts of faith. For as the Stomack in the body muſt be looked unto, becauſe it maintains the blood and ſpirits, if the ſtomack takes not in and receives, all the reſt of the parts of the body will decay. Or as the fountain and water head muſt be kept continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cleer; becauſe it ſils the ſtream and the pipe. Or that I may ſet it out more familiarly; As a man that hath a great family and many mouths to feed, he takes care that he hath receipts coming in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably. If we get not in from Chriſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, nothing that is required wil go on well, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:159991:13"/>be well performed: Out of the receipts of faith, you are to purifie your hearts, and to mortifie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; The receipts of faith muſt ſtrengthen comfort and incourage your hearts in God, and put you on upon prayer and all other things. Every duty you perform muſt be done in the ſtrength which you receive from Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore you need receive much. We are troubled if the earth yields not forth its increaſe, If by our Trade, comings in are not according to our expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: We are juſtly troubled if we find diſtance and ſtrangeneſs of heart between us and Jeſus Chriſt, If our Souls cloſe not by faith with Jeſus Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, but ſtands off, and ſtands out with him: We are as well to be troubled if we receive not of his fulneſs. Thou oughteſt as much to put thy faith upon receiving, as upon adhering unto Jeſus Chriſt. That thou majeſt adhere and cleave unto Chriſt by faith, thou ſaieſt that Chriſt is thy life, and thou art undone if thou reſt not thy ſelf upon him: Thou art undone alſo if thou doſt not receive of his fulneſs. Union with Jeſus Chriſt is done by faith at once, Receiving from Chriſt is to be done daily. You will cleave unto Chriſt ſo much the faſter as you find you have received from him. Whether ſhall we go from thee, ſay they, thou haſt the words of eternall life, <hi>John</hi> 6.68. When they had once found life in Jeſus Chriſt, they could not tel how to leave him. Like fooliſh Children that play with the breaſt, but ſuck not, Such folly is in our hearts. We muſt have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſuitable to al our conditions, but we let them lie by us, and we improve them not. Though we have a right in Chriſt, yet we draw not from him Grace for Grace. Like perſons that lay up Gold, but it is for ſome ſpeciall uſe, Or like Cordials that are taken only in extraordinary fits, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:159991:13"/>So do we make uſe of faith. But as a worldly man counts there is ſo much loſs as there is no laying out of the money that lies by him, If his money lies by him any time, he counts there is ſo much loſs to him, becauſe it might have brought him in ſomthing. So count ſo much loſs of your faith, as you want uſe of it in receiving from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as you ought to put your faith thus upon the act of receiving. So put it upon receiving much. The receipt of a little from Chriſt, is as much as nothing to him, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. <hi>Hitherto you have ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing in my name:</hi> They had asked, but he counts it nothing, becauſe it was not anſwerable unto the intereſt that Chriſt had in his Father nor ſuitable to what he had purchaſed for them, nor unto the power that Chriſt had to give. You have asked nothing in my name. In my name, that is, as having my right made over to you, and as having as much to do with the things you need, as I have that am Lord over all. I ſay, Chriſt counts every thing leſs than this, nothing. If you ask leſs than this, you ask nothing, and if you receive leſs than this you receive nothing. Faith may have what it wil. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.29. <hi>Be it to thee according to thy Faith.</hi> If faith opens its mouth wide, it ſhall be filled. As it was in the gathering of Mannah, Every one had as much as his has ket was, although it was never ſo great that he brought to gather it in. If thy faith be great, thou ſhalt have great things, If thy faith be ſmall thou ſhalt have precious things. As there ought not to be the leaſt doubt or queſtion in a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, becauſe God is ſo able to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſo faithfull and true, So there ought not to be any queſtion or exceptions of any thing to be received that is in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe al is yours.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:159991:14"/>Obſerve it. Faith is indefinitly called a receiving, becauſe it receives this and that, that which is eſſentiall, and that which is conſequentiall. That which is for the inward and for the outward man, for mortification, and vivification, for faith and for holineſs. Faith is a receiving without any limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As none may ſay that he is rejected, becauſe the promiſe runs indefinitly, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Who ever beleeves ſhall be ſaved.</hi> So none may ſay that this and that cannot be had by faith which is promiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe faith is indefinitly called a receiving. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs we have received Grace for Grace.</hi> Mark the Text. We have received of his fulneſs. You are to go unto the Well head, to fetch water out of the Sea, Gold out of the Mine, you are to take from fulneſs, and therefore you ſhould not take a little. <hi>You are to receive Grace for Grace.</hi> The meaning of it lies thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One Grace is to be unto you a pawn and a pledg of another, One kindneſs, of another. For as God loves, becauſe he loves, So God gives Grace becauſe he hath given Grace. When you go to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing from him, you are not ſo much to look at his Act in giving, nor at your own act in uſing of his Grace, as you are to look at this, that he hath given Grace: He gives Grace for Grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or thus, <hi>Grace for Grace.</hi> That is, as face an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to face in a glaſs, that there may be a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>litude between us and Chriſt. That as what impreſſion is upon the Seal is left in the wax, ſo what Grace and favor God hath ſhewed unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in aboundance, we ſhould receive in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance. You are to receive Grace according to the Grace that is in Chriſt. So that by faith you may boldly ſay unto God that Chriſt hath this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:159991:14"/>Grace and he hath it in abundance, although I may not have it in his abundance, yet in the abundance that I am capable of, beſtow it on me, and ſend me not away without it. And as we are thus to put our faith upon this act of receiving, and receiving much, So</p>

               <p>Thirdly: Let nothing hinder or take you off from it. There ſhould be no interruption or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to any obedience, eſpecially not in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of faith: Becauſe faith feeds every Grace in the Soul, and puts every faculty upon its work. In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Gird up the Loyns of your mind, and truſt perfectly.</hi> Gird up the Loyns of your mind. They were wont in thoſe Eaſtern parts to wear long garments, and to gird them up to their Loyns that they might not hang under their feet when they went to run. The meaning of the Apoſtle is, whatever may hinder faith from perfection, or from doing its perfect work, that put from you. And in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9, 10, 11, 12, 13. the Apoſtle ſpeaks altogether of faith as receiving. <hi>Receiving the end of your Faith, the ſalvation of your Souls.</hi> For he ſpeaks of the Prophets, of their looking to recoive what they did foretell; And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and receive with meekneſs the ingrafted word which is able to ſave your Souls.</hi> Obſerve that word [Lay aſide and Receive the word that is ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted] That a man ſhould lay aſide any thing, that he may receive from Jeſus Chriſt. And if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare that place with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. He exhorts them to put away every thing that may hinder their deſires, As <hi>James</hi> exhorts to put away all things that may
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:159991:15"/>hinder from receiving. It comes to this. As no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould take away your hearts from deſiring much, ſo nothing ſhould hinder you from receiving much.</p>
               <p>Firſt: Let not ſin hinder you. Therefore mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie every corruption, becauſe it keeps good things from you, and takes away your heart, and hinders the application of your ſelves to Chriſt. Sin d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oh incapacitate the Soul that it can receive nothing elſe, And it ſils it as the ſtomack with wind, that it can get nothing down. Guilt infeebles and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the hopes of a man, and makes him afraid to draw neer to God. Yea beloved, if you would mourn kindly, and bitterly, and heartily for your ſins, the beſt way is to receive from Jeſus Chriſt. For in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. when he had given them a new heart, and purged them from all their Idols, then ſaith the Text they ſhall abhor themſelves in duſt and aſhes for all their doings that are not good. <hi>Then:</hi> that is, eſpecially then moſt kindly, and moſt abundantly. Againſt ſin we ought to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with violence, bitterneſs and indignation, for this very reaſon, becauſe it keeps good things from us. It hinders us of the gain we might make in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. Eſpecially take heed of the pride of your hearts, for that is immediatly oppoſite to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. <hi>If any man withdraw himſelf my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi> If thou haſt never ſo much yet its nothing to what thou oughteſt to receive. Thou oughteſt to receive not only what may help thee in thy work but what may ſhew forth the riches of Jeſus Chriſt in thee. It muſt be ſeen what he can give, and what he hath to give: and therefore when thou haſt received pray for capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more. Yea indeed if thou doſt receive, it will inlarge thy deſires and affections after more.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:159991:15"/>Therefore take heed of pride which is oppoſite to faith as it is a receiving. Take heed of that. It ſhews it ſelf divers waies.</p>
               <p>Sometimes in this, becauſe a man refuſeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Chriſt becauſe he is unworthy. Which in plain Engliſh, and in the ſenſe that it hath with God is as much as this, that a man would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him, nor be beholden to him, for any thing, but what he finds a ſuitableneſs and fitneſs in himſelf for. As the ſpirits of ſome people are ſo ſtout, that they had rather ſtarve, than ask, It's a ſhame to them to receive, and a greater miſery than to endure any thing that can be laid upon them. So it is with our hearts. We can complain and roare out becauſe of our wants, but we have no mind to receive, although it be put to our lips, juſt like men that are ſick, we ſhut our lips againſt it, and cannot take it down. Our hearts would willingly have ſomething from God, but as a reward, and not meerly as a gift, ſomething for doing what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, but not as an alms purely. Faith even for this very reaſon is difficult to the Soul of a man, becauſe that it makes him to live dependantly, and to have its good and happineſs out of its ſelf. But if the pride of your hearts would ſuffer you to receive, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding God will not give to them that are proud. <hi>For God reſiſts the proud. and gives Grace to the humble, Jam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>You ask and receive not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you would ſpend it on your luſts,</hi> upon your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, in <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3. whereas God reſiſts the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</p>
               <p>Secondly: And as you ought not to be hindred by ſin: So to be diſcouraged by nothing in this act of Faith. If you look in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. the Apoſtle hath theſe words, <hi>Lift up the hand</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the hand that hangs down, and the feeble knees.</hi> His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:159991:16"/>is this, that it is the method &amp; cunning of Satan to hinder our faith by diſcouragements. If he cannot kil &amp; deſtroy it directly and immediately, then he doth what he can to cauſe the Acts of it to be weak and without ſtrength. Be not diſcouraged in your receiving by any thing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No not by Gods delays and denyals of you. In <hi>Math.</hi> 15.23. to 28. You have to this purpoſe the example of the woman of Canaan, that although Chriſt cals her a dog, and had nothing for her, yet ſhe grows as the more humble to ask a dogs part, ſo the more earneſt to ask and beg and knock. As a party that goes to receive mony, if he cannot find the man, he goes again and again till he finds him. So although you have not at the firſt asking, yet ask again. The reaſon why you have it not at firſt is not becauſe you ſhal not have it, but that you may know you have it gratis, for asking. What though you receive not preſently? know that it is an almes, and therefore you ſhould waite. And though you be importunate and God repreſents himſelf as one that is aſleepe and that hath the door ſhut to him, yet know that he wil ariſe and open to you as he ſpeaks in the Goſpel of <hi>Luke.</hi> Though he cals you dog (as I inſtanced before) yet his meaning is that he is come for you though not in the firſt place, yet in the ſecond, and if he gives you but crums, yet he wil give you the Childrens Bread.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither be diſcouraged in this act by the ſmalneſs of your receipt, Although you have gotten but a little in the uſe of many ordinances many yeares. For mark it, If you get never ſo little, you get by that a title to al, &amp; you ſhal have al in Gods own time. That litle is like the bunch of Grapes which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:159991:16"/>intereſts you in al the land of promiſe. There was a bleſſing left in the Berry, though there was but here and there one left upon the Tree. They that make often and quick returns, although they get but little at a time, yet they get much in the whol. Lay therefore al thy gettings together, I ſay al toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; conſider not the returns ſent in, in one praier, or one ſermon, or one ejaculation or caſting your heart into Heaven, but lay al together. Beggars take any thing that is given them, they are not chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, they will be contented with the ſmalleſt. That money which is not currant with others will paſs with them. The ſmalleſt piece of ſilver you have, is a kindneſs to them. Such meat as is not of uſe in the family, is dainties and of uſe with them. Herein thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelf to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, in that thou art contented to be at Gods allowance. Beloved, you are receivers, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of free Grace. You have it not becauſe you earned it, but becauſe God doth abound and is rich in good works. And therefore although you have never ſo little, you have cauſe to rejoyce. Thou art but a receiver by faith, and therefore thou haſt no cauſe to murmur. Thou haſt al things of Grace, and thou ſhalt have every thing if thou ſubmitteſt unto God in every thing he doth as pleaſing unto thee for him to do what he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as you have not cauſe to be diſcouraged at the ſmalneſs of your receipt, So neither are you to be diſcouraged in your receiving by the greatneſs of your wants. For the promiſe runs thus, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.22. <hi>All things whatever ye ask in my name, beleeving, you ſhall receive.</hi> If you want all things, yet if you ſhall have whatever you ſhall ask then believe that there is nothing that the greatneſs of your wants can amount unto, that ſhould make
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:159991:17"/>you ſay within your ſelves that this cannot be, nor that cannot be given. The greater things you ask the ſooner you ſhall have. God gives bleſſings like himſelfe. The promiſe is indefinite; And if you ask you ſhall receive.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be not diſcouraged in this act of faith by the greatneſs of your receipts. For although you have received much, yet look for more. <hi>He gives liberally, and upbraids not,</hi> James 1.5. He doth not ſay I have given you this, and that, and ſo often, and releeved you in ſo many wants, and ſet you up when you have been bankrupts, and ſet you up in the ſtate wherein you were, many a time. There is this reaſon why the greatneſs of your receipts ſhould not diſcourage you, becauſe the more you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the more there is yet behind to receive. I ſay there is more yet behind to receive. To whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever much is given, God looks for much from them <hi>Luke</hi> 12.48. <hi>He gives Grace for Grace,</hi> as you heard. <hi>John</hi> 1.16. If he gives much Grace, he wil give more Grace in a like proportion. We are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ask of them again, whom we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved lately from. But here you need not; for God hath much to give, and that which you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is not in your own name, but in the name of him that is the Lord of all even Jeſus Chriſt, God gives often, that there may be a fruition and Communion between you and him. He gives you but a little at a time that you may come oftner: and he gives you often becauſe you may know that whenever you come, you are welcome to him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: And as you ought not to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: So eſpecially I beſeech you take heed of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing what is offered to you. There is nothing more oppoſite to receiving than refufing. In
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:159991:17"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46, 47. ſaith the Text there, <hi>They did reject &amp; put away from them the words, &amp; they did judgthe m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthy of eternall life.</hi> Seeing you put it from you, and judg your ſelves unworthy of eternal life. That putting away is directly oppoſite to this recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Whoever doth put away the gracethat Gods of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, he doth by that act paſs Judgment upon himſelf, as one that is worthy to have deſtruction for his portion. And they did put it away by contradicting &amp; blaſpheming, and by queſtioning without any kind of reaſoning, but meerly out of the enmity that was in their Spirits unto the Doctrine which the Apoſtle preached concerning free juſtification. So much ſhal ſuffice to have ſpoken of the ſecond Uſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>IF Faith be a Receiving, then by that property try whether your Faith be true or not. What is the Spirit of it? Is it a having, and a craving, and a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging appetite and deſire in thee that can never be ſatisfied and contented? Faith will make a man to live upon that he hath, that is, to take the comfort of it: But it looks after more than it hath. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> ſaith the Text in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. But what is that Faith? A patient waiting, that when you have done the will of God in one thing, you may receive the promiſe in another; And a patient waiting upon him as one that will not tarry long. Faith makes a man to wait for far greater
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:159991:18"/>things, than it hath already received. This is the property of faith; Give it but one thing that is good, and you muſt give it all. As he that commits one ſin, and commits it but once, gets thereby a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto every ſin. So he that doth excerciſe true faith once upon Chriſt muſt alwaies have from Chriſt. As perſons that long, muſt have every thing they ſee, elſe they are ready to die. So faith looks for all from God, and from none elſe. It takes all that comes from God, and looks for all that it knows God hath to give. And hence it comes to paſs that if one Beleever ſees another in his party-colored coat (as I may cal it, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of the old Teſtament where the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved child was ſo cloathed) If a Beleever ſees ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloathed with Peace and Joy through belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, It works doubting in him and queſtioning whether he be a child of God, becauſe he hath not received thoſe gifts, or hath not received ſo much from God as others have.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> It may be ſome will ſay unto me here, <hi>I have cauſe to complain, for I have not received: And I have reaſon to complain becauſe of my wants; I want Faith, and I want love, and I want patience, and</hi> I <hi>want beavenly mindedneſs: And it is not a little of theſe things that I want neither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet know that complaining is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you have not received: Becauſe our hearts are ſo full of injuſtice that they will deny that to be paid them by God, which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But it is an argument that you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and that you have Faith, becauſe you would have more, and are unſatisfied with what you have received. For Faith is a receiving.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:159991:18"/>
               <p>Object. <hi>This is my Condition ſaith one, that I am unquiet till I get all; when I have a little, then if I could get but this and that, I ſhould be contented; and I bow my knee before God for it, and he gives it to me; but when I have it, I am where I was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer: Although thou ſhouldſt do well to ceaſe murmuring when thou haſt gotten any thing (for a little will go far) but it is beſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thy receipts be, that thou ſhouldſt look after more. The Grace and Comfort that thou haſt is likely to be true, becauſe it doth enlarge thy heart, and make thee ſtill to be a receiver. Learn to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh therefore between murmuring and covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Covet ſpiritual Gifts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1. Covet, thou maiſt; that is, thou maiſt be as covetous after a thing that God hath, as a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man is after any thing in the world. But murmur, thou maiſt not; for murmuring ſuppoſeth all to be thy due. And then whatever God ſhould give thee, thou ſhouldſt not receive as an Alms from him, and he ſhould loſe his Glory. Coveting, is a deſiring much from God: and murmuring, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining to think that God ſhould give to any beſides thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>To ſhut up this Uſe therefore, examine what thy Faith ſets thy Deſires after. And that thou maiſt judgaright, Conſider,</p>
               <p>Whether it be Gifts or Grace? If it be Gifts, confider whether it be gifts meerly or not, or gifts that are ſanctified? If it be gifts meerly, then it is no argument of grace, nay, an argument that thou ſhalt not receive from God; in <hi>James</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. <hi>You ask and receive not, becauſe you would ſpend it on your luſts:</hi> You would be counted more for them, and more eminent Chriſtians than others, and to be the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:159991:19"/>greater Stars; and after your motions you would have all the reſt to walk: but God reſiſts ſuch proud men. If ſo be it be after Gifts, that is, that thou maiſt have power of ſpeech, or utterance, and be able to reaſon every Point and matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to ſay ſomthing to every thing that may ariſe, there is more ſuſpition, I ſay more ſuſpition: But if it be after Gifts that are ſanctified, or eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be after much grace; thou haſt the faith of adherence, and thou wouldſt have faith of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; thou doſt adhere ſomtimes, but thou wouldſt have no diſtance between thy ſoul and Chriſt at any time, and at no time have a hankering of ſoul after relief any other way but from Chriſt. If thou longeſt after Grace, after Love, and after more Godly Sorrow, then thou haſt leſs cauſe to be troubled, becauſe thou feeleſt thy wants; and thy feeling of thy wants, is but only. the life of thy Faith as it is a Receiver.</p>

               <p>I ſhall Inſtance in Three Particulars.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:159991:19"/>
               <p>Firſt: Wait continually upon the Means and Ordinances. Jeſus Chriſt is to be found among the Doctors (that I may allude unto that ſtory of him.) The Ordinances may be called the highway wherin Jeſus Chriſt comes, that ſo he may cure the blind and the lame. If you look into <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8.11. you ſhall find the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the gifts which Jeſus Chriſt hath received for men, he gives to them by Paſtors and Teachers, and the work of the Miniſtry.</hi> And if you compare the 20. verſe with the verſes that follow after, the Apoſtle cleerly ſaith, that that man doth not walk like a Saint, nor worthy of his calling who doth not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto the Ordinances. He doth not carry him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like himſelf. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I beſeech you walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of your calling wherewith ye are called,</hi> and then he comes and tels them that God hath appointed the Miniſters to bring them together, And when they are together to fil them with gifts according to that meaſure that Jeſus Chriſt hath received of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for them. As faith doth at firſt come by hearing ſo it is nouriſhed by hearing and other Ordinances, A Beleever is not one that lives immediatly upon God, but upon God by means:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.</note> For to live upon God immediately is the life of ſight and not of faith. It's as directly oppoſite unto a life of faith, to neglect Ordinances, as faith and ſight are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite. And therefore you ſhal find that by the word and ordinances faith is wrought in men in the daies of the new Teſtament, though the ſpirit be given abundantly. The Goſpel is the power of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, as it is preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. It is the immortall ſeed whereby men are regenerated and begotten again as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. As in the times of the old Teſtament the word and the ſpirit went together, And ſo it doth ſtill, And that Covenant is eſtabliſhed for ever. How
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:159991:20"/>can they beleeve ſaith the Apoſtle therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. except they have heard? and how can they hear whithout a preacher? There are none more greedy of Ordinances than thoſe that have had their Faith by them, or that have received (which is the phraſe here in the Text) the fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt by them. As ſoon as ever men have been converted, though their faith have been excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding weak, yet then they have put themſelves upon the uſe of the Ordinances, as I might ſhew you out of <hi>John</hi> 4. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2 and divers other places. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. when the Apoſtle would ſet down the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Jews, and that they ſhould receive no more, he ſets them down as being barred and ſhut out from the uſe of the Ordinances which God gave to his people. If Faith be a Receiving then he continually attending upon the Means and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, becauſe by them Jeſus Chriſt doth convey his fulneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly: Whatever you do receive, be humble in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>What haſt thou which thou haſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? and if thou haſt received it, why doſt thou boaſt?</hi> If what thou haſt attained unto were either of thy ſelf, or given thee for what thou haſt done, thou mightſt then glory as having made a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between thy ſelf and others. But when all hath been upon receipts thou muſt be humble. Shall one letter bag be counted better than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe its filled with Gold? Or one earthen veſſell more precious than another, becauſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquor is put into it. Pride ſaith, as <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar, This is</hi> Babell <hi>that I have built:</hi> but Faith ſaith quite contrary; This thou haſt received, and if thou haſt received it, then be not proud.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: If thou wouldſt carry thy ſelf as one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:159991:20"/>that it is a receiver, then be communicative. In <hi>Mtah.</hi> 10.8. <hi>Freely ye have received, therefore freely give.</hi> Such ought to be our communication unto men, as they are unto us from God. Let the Saints have the uſe of all, and be forward to uſe whatever they have gotten for their good, for to this end you have received it. He that had a Talent, you know received it, not to lay up, but to lay out. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf hath his gifts to diſtribute.</p>
               <p>And if any man ſhould ſay, they are ſo and ſo and ſo with whom I do converſe.</p>
               <p>The Text tels you that he hath received gifts for the rebellious, and to lead captivity captive, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. He overcomes the oppoſition in men by the gifts which he gives and beſtows upon men. Why ſhould Chriſtians be ſo reſerved, and keep their oyl to themſelves? why ſhould they be ſo backward to comfort and direct others, with the ſame comforts and directions which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? For if God hath put theſe things into you, its but that you may put them into others. Why hath he communicated unto you a ſpirituall gift, but that others may be edified by you? Even as what one member of the body hath, is for the good of the whol and the more you uſe what you have, the more you ſhall receive. There is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an eaſineſs of exerciſe of Grace to be gotten hereby, but an abundance of Grace. God lets rain fall upon the Mountains, that it may run down upon the Valleys. The more thou art willing, and uſefull, and communicating, the more uſe thou haſt of thy grace, the more grace thou ſhalt have from God. As the things of this life are given unto men, not for themſelves, but that they may do publique ſervice, ſo ſpecially is Grace given. Thou haſt more faith than another, It is to this end, that thou maieſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage another. Thou canſt take freely of Grace,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:159991:21"/>It is to this end, that thou maieſt incourage another to do as thou doſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE V.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the laſt place. If Faith be a receiving, then there is ſtrong Conſolation to all them that have this Faith. Conſolation in this, That thou haſt a right to all, all things are for you, and you have a power or an hand given you to take all. You are made the great receivers of the eſtate and riches of Jeſus Chriſt. And you are not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers in truſt, but what you do receive, you have a right unto. And let this comfort you againſt the weakneſs and inability that you find to do any ſervice for God. You can do nothing, but know, that the great and main work is not doing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7. As the ground doth drink in the rain, and receive the ſeed before it can bring forth fruit for him by whom it is dreſt. So muſt you firſt get from Jeſus Chriſt, before you can bear fruit unto him.</p>
               <p>And it is a Comfort to you in this, that though you do loſe much, and ſuffer much loſs in ſomthing for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, you ſhall have it again, whatever thou parteſt with, that the Grace of Faith may rule in thee. I ſay whatever thou parteſt withall; thou haſt by the Grace of Faith ſomthing whereby thou maieſt receive that in a better kind and much more. As men pay money in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and take a bill to receive it in another with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo now when thou parteſt with thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and with thy underſtanding that thou mai'ſt receive from Jeſus Chriſt, thou doſt it but that thou maiſt receive ten times more at the hand of Jeſus Chriſt, than what thou partedſt with, and every way as good for thee.</p>
               <p>And ſo I have now done with the generall poins, that Faith is a receiving.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>How Faith Receives.</hi> 1. <hi>By an Act of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> 2. <hi>By an Act of the Will. Faith as it is an act of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding doth ſeverall Works.</hi> Firſt, <hi>It doth the office of an Informer, and that in ſeverall particulars.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I now come particularly to open how Faith doth Receive. And for that,</p>
               <p>Faith doth receive by the Act of the mind or the Underſtanding, or</p>
               <p>By the Act of the Will.</p>
               <p>Theſe Two faculties, the Underſtanding, and the Will, are like hands by which we receive Jeſus Chriſt and his fulneſs: Or they are like ſeverall Veſſels and Barns which are filled with his fulneſs. If you look into the Scripture, you ſhall find that, To Receive is aſcribed unto the underſtanding. I wil mention but one place of many. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The naturall man cannot receive the things of God: He receivs them not, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> When Chriſt had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in parables unto the people, he uſeth this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.12. <hi>He that can receive it, let him receive it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Receiving is not only a work of the mind and underſtanding, but a work alſo of the Will. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Him that is weak in Faith Receive.</hi> Receive, what is that? He ſpeaks of ſuch a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to <hi>Philem.</hi> ver. 12. writes concerning <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> which was nothing elſe but a welcoming and kind entertaining of him with love. The Text that I have in hand <hi>(As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as received him)</hi> muſt be underſtood of both theſe.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:159991:22"/>
               <p>You muſt underſtand this Receiving of an act of the mind. For in the verſe before the Text, he ſpeaks of light and inlightning, and bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the light. And therefore the receiving this light, is by having the eyes of their mind inlightned and opened. And on the contrary, thoſe that receive not Chriſt, are faid to be in darkneſs or without underſtanding. And in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>By Faith we underſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this receiving alſo is an act of the Will. For it notes the taking of a thing as our own, and the near and intimate conjunction unto it. As a man you know that doth receive meat, or as one that receives an Eſtate or poſſeſſion, or (as I ſaid in the beginning) a Friend entertains a Friend. So we are ſaid here to entertain Chriſt. In <hi>John</hi> 10.38. <hi>We know and Beleeve.</hi> Believing being diſtinct from knowledge, muſt needs argue an act of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faculty of the Soul (the Will) It is true, faith is but one habit, but yet there are divers acts of that habit which are coordinate one unto another. An Act in the underſtanding, as well as an Act in the Will. Faith is ſeated but in one faculty, but yet that one faculty hath a redundance into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If we ſhould ſay the Will is the ſubject of Faith, becauſe Faith is a Grace, and from it a man is denominated good, which a man is not from any habit of the underſtanding, yet ſtill we ſay faith hath a work upon the underſtanding. And if we ſay Faith is in the underſtanding, yet we ſay it hath a work upon the Will in making it to delight in that which the underſtanding preſents unto it. There is an acurateneſs in determining which faculty faith is in, but we need not ſtand upon that, becauſe there is ſomthing that this work of faith doth in both. And if we look into the Scripture, we ſhall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:159991:22"/>find it ſpeaks as it is an act of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant juſtify many,</hi> Iſay 53.11. And they that are taught of God come unto him, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times faith is deſcribed by a confidence and truſt of our ſelves upon God through Chriſt. But when faith is deſcribed by an act of the underſtanding, you are to ſuppoſe allwaies that there goes an act of the Will with it. And when Faith is deſcribed by an act of the Will, you muſt alwaies ſuppoſe that there goes an act of the underſtanding alſo. For they only that know the name of God truſt in him.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10.</note> Whether the Underſtanding or the Will be firſt wrought upon, I ſhal not ſpeak to now (ſomthing peradventure may fall in before I have done this point.) But I ſhall now fal upon the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, becauſe men have ſuffered their light to be put out, and while they cry out againſt a bare notionall knowledg of the things of God, they have loſt the knowledg of it. Faith (I ſay) is an act of receiving. And by Faith as it is an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding act. I ſhall open that in ſome particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt: Faith doth the office of an Informer, or it brings in news &amp; tidings into the Soul of what good is to be had in Jeſus Chriſt. It is as it were an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voice or bill of lading, or advice of what commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; advantages Jeſus Chriſt is ful of. As Merchants you know have their Factors abroad to inform them what wares and commodities are to be had in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries, and what goes off and bears price. Or as there are particulars and ſurveys given of Land unto purchaſers, that they may know every thing they deal for. So Faith now (as it is in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) it gives in a particular unto the Soul of what Chriſt is appointed to do, and hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give unto poor ſinners. And hence it is in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:159991:23"/>the Scripture called a teaching, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44, 45. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>can come unto me except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draws him,</hi> as it is written, <hi>They ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll be all taught of God, Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father comes unto me.</hi> And in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. It's called an opening of the Eyes to take in that which is to be received. <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſaith Paul) I <hi>bow my knees unto the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that the eyes of your mind being enlightned, yee may know what is the hope of your calling, &amp;c.</hi> And it is called a revealing, and making known of the Myſtery, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>Who hath beleeved our report, and to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</hi> As the Apoſtle quotes the words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. and beloved the things which faith doth reveal, cannot be known otherwiſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen nor Ear heard, nor is the heart of man able to conceive what God hath laid up for them that love him.</hi> But we have this mind of Chriſt whereby we know him: we have the knowledg of the deep things of God. It is hidden wiſdom, &amp; not to be found out by man, in ver. 9. and 14. <hi>the Natural man cannot diſcern it.</hi> As weak eyes cannot look upon the light: Or as ſome ſmall prints cannot be read by ſome tender eyes. There is in all ordinary things which faith believes, and receives, ſome extraordinary things. As for example: By faith a man knows the world was made of nothing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. But his Faith reſts not there, but he looks upon all the promiſes of God as being made by God that hath ſuch power to perform them, and reſts upon them accordingly. He looks upon all as comming through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.19. He looks upon things as paſſing knowledg. I pray that Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith, that you may comprehend what paſſeth knowledg.</p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:159991:23"/>
               <p>And as Faith will reveal and tell a man nothing that is ordinary, but wonders; ſo it informs a man certainly. It brings nothing that is liable to a falſhood, or a queſtion. It cannot but come to paſs which Faith reveals, becauſe Faith hath alwaies the Word and Truth of God for its Object. It will ſpeak nothing but what it hath from Gods own mouth; and the words of his mouth are as pure as Silver ſeven times tryed in the fire, in which there is no droſs at all. Unto this end, that Faith may make the ſoul to know what is to be had, and to be gotten by Jeſus Chriſt. It doth particularly ſet before us the benefits of Jeſus Chriſt, or the End of God the Father in giving Chriſt. He is Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption. It reveals them as thoſe things that are to be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto by us. And upon this is ſpeaks unto the Soul, as the Patriarch did unto his Son when there was a Famine in the Land, <hi>There is Corn in</hi> Egypt, <hi>why do you not go thither?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So Faith tells a man what he ſhould pray for, and look for; and it ſaith unto him, Thou art troubled becauſe thy heart is barren, but is there not fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in Jeſus Chriſt? And though thy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be dim, and cannot ſee the bottom of things, yet is there not light ſhining in him? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Soul needs, there is a ſupply of in Jeſus Chriſt, and Faith informs a man of ſo much. It makes known both the power and love of God the Father in his perſon, and the holineſs of Chriſt, and his ſatisfaction and purchaſe, and the ſtate to which he is riſen. Theſe things are neceſſary to be known, and without them no man can receive any thing at the hand of Chriſt; he muſt know Jeſus Chriſt to be God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. <hi>This is the true God, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi> And until a man doth thus know him, he hath no underſtanding, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:159991:24"/>there, <hi>We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding to know him that is true, and we are in him that is true; and this is the true God and eternal Life.</hi> Faith upon Chriſt is the greateſt Idolatry and Superſtition that can be, till the ſoul be cleer in this; and the greateſt folly for a man to commit himſelf to Chriſt, if he were not God. You muſt alſo know the Satisfaction of Chriſt: For this indeed is that which troubles the ſoul of a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, That there muſt be mends made, and reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution unto God for al that diſhonor which ſin hath done him, which he cannot do by all his duties and engagements, nor by reformation for the future.</p>
               <p>And not only doth it inform a man of particulars, but of the readineſs and willingneſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt, and in the Father to part with all theſe things. A readineſs in Chriſt; that he is ſent of the Father, and made as a common Stock, out of whom he communicates, even as the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his ſinfulneſs to his. Therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reveals him as a Stock and Head, as one that is intruſted in the behalf of ſinners, as one that hath received Commandment from the Father that he ſhould call them, and having called them, ſhould bear them in his Arms untill he brings them to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And for the readineſs of God the Father, It reveals unto the Soul that he hath received a price, and therefore all that is to be given, is a debt: That this Price did but make way for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods good Will from all Eternity; and as he could not til he was ſatisfied (becauſe of the honor of his Juſtice) give us; ſo he cannot being ſatisfied (becauſe it would be a diſhonor to Juſtice) but give us. I might be large, but the Sum of all is this: That there is a neceſſity of the knowledge of the Goſpel required of thoſe that do beleeve, or required unto the receiving of any thing from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:159991:24"/>Chriſt. Information of the myſtery of the Goſpel is the way whereby we come to be made partakers of all the Grace of the Goſpel. As the heat comes in with the light into the Air, So doth alſo with the knowledg of Chriſt, the things of Chriſt. <hi>They that know thy name, they will truſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in thee,</hi> Pſal. 9.10. I know whom I have truſted. <hi>How can ye beleeve except ye have heard?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. While men are not in fear, nor ſenſible of their danger, So long (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) the fool be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves every thing and will hope in any thing, and make any thing to be the foundation and ground of their truſt and confidence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.15. But when Conſcience comes to be troubled, and when a man comes to ſee what muſt be done to ſatisfie the wrath of God, then a man grows wary and is afraid of truſting to any thing that is not ſufficient, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bear him up in the day of tryall.</p>
               <p>You ſhall find ſomtimes in the Scripture, Faith ſet out by Wiſdom, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.8. <hi>He hath abounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in all wiſdom and knowledg.</hi> So Chriſt is made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption. Wiſdom, that is, he gives Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it follows afterwards, that he is made unto us righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. Theſe words compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all we have in Chriſt, both in this world and in the World to come. There is righteouſneſs and ſanctification when we do beleeve in him: There is wiſdom that we may be partakers of that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſanctification: And Redemption or gathering together of the body again out of the duſt into which it moulders, that you may be for ever with the Lord. That Wiſdom there going before righteouſneſs, muſt needs be meant concerning Faith. Faith therfore doth make a man wiſe. And the reaſon why it is ſo called, is becauſe it makes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:159991:25"/>the Soul to deal exceeding warily, and charily, and upon good grounds. Elſe a man would take the moſt ordinary Bayl (as I may cal it) the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt grounds and reaſons for his hope that could be. As a wiſe man wil not adventure his Eſtate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of any one whom he knows not wel but he wil have good grounds &amp; know whom he truſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he truſts, he wil have ſomthing to ſhew for that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he truſts another. A wiſe man wil not take every ones word, but will enquire what the mans Eſtate and goodneſs is that promiſeth to pay him. So a man becomes wiſe; Faith makes a man exceeding chary and wary leaſt that he ſhould lay ſo great a building upon a foundation or principle that will not hold out in the day of the Lord. Al the time of a mans unregeneracy, a man adventures himſelf and puts all his hope upon ſuch things as in reaſon (indeed) will give him no kind of confidence. What argument is this, that becauſe <hi>Haman</hi> was called to the banquet of the King, therefore it was that he might have all the honor done to him, which might be done to a ſubject? What argument is this, that becauſe a man hath long life and an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of theſe outward things, that therfore God hath no ſcore againſt him, &amp; that his ſins are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; done away? Fooliſh &amp; abſurd things do men lay as the bottome ſtone upon which they lay their hope during the time of their unregeneracy. But when faith is wrought, men wil know good reaſon before they do confide or truſt themſelves. They know God is good that hath promiſed, but they will have ſomething to intimate to them that the promiſe is to them, and that they have a ſhare in it: and therefore it comes to paſs that that which men count the miſery of Chriſtians, is their happineſs and commendation, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are ſo full of doubts, and impreſſions, and fears, leaſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:159991:25"/>this, and that, and a third ſhould not abide the touch in the day of the Lord. The more a mans faith doth thus inform him, the more opportunity he hath of receiving much, and of growing much into the fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. If ſo be I may bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſome meaner repreſentation of it, it is in this caſe as it is with Merchants that have quick advice from beyond Seas, they know what to buy, and what will put off, and what wil yield greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and they gain much, and grow rich quickly: They get and vend the commodity to their great profit in a little while. So now doth a Chriſtian too. When his Faith and Conſcience is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly telling him that there is this to be had, and with this prayer, and with this Saint, and under this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance you may be fitted with this and that and with a third Comfort or Grace according as your need requireth. A Chriſtian grows to a very great degree in a little time.</p>

                     <hi>A ſecond Work of Faith as it is an Act of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> viz. <hi>To perſwade the Soul to an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. A third work, is to perſwade the Soul to go to Jeſus Chriſt for all things revealed to be in him. A fourth work is, to keep in mind the thoughts of theſe things thus revealed.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEcondly: And as Faith doth thus in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding inform, So it doth perſwade the Soul unto an aſſent, that is to judg and approve all the things that are revealed to be reall and true. Faith in the Underſtanding doth reveal the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed as real and ſubſtantial, &amp; not barely as news<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:159991:26"/>but as matters of concernment; and not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment only, but as the things which cannot be otherwiſe. And therefore it works a firm aſſent in the ſoul, ſo as nothing can make it think otherwiſe. Nothing can make it queſtion whether theſe things be not to be had in Chriſt which it doth reveal. And ſo you have it in <hi>John</hi> 3.33. <hi>He that doth beleeve ſets to his Seal that God is true.</hi> He ſets to his Seal. It's a further confirmation (you know) in Law, for a man to ſet to his ſeal before witneſs than it is for a man to paſs his promiſe. When the Seal is ſet, there is no plea, as wel as no going back: That is the fulleſt confirmation ſuch a confirmation as <hi>Amen,</hi> and ſuch a ful aſſent doth faith work in the Soul concerning what it knows of Jeſus Chriſt: So that Faith wil ſay, It's true, and it cannot be queſtioned, and it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted, It is worthy of all acceptation, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith in another caſe. And let the cunning and ſubtilty of Satan be what it will be, yet he holds that ſure which is ſpoken concerning the promiſes. And hence in all the troubles in the minds of the Saints, their trouble is not ſo much for any thing as this, that there being ſuch things to be had, that they have no ſhare nor portion in them as they fear. For the ſetting forth of this firm aſſent, In <hi>Bſay</hi> 53.1. <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>hath beleeved our report,</hi> and that word there <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>[Beleeved]</hi> is of ſuch a conjugation in the Hebrew Tongue, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a thing out to be true, It gives it a being, that is, it makes the thing as reall, as if the thing revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, were revealed unto ſenſe, and to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by the eye, or ear, or the like. And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. it is ſaid that <hi>Abraham</hi> becauſe he had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, was fully perſwaded, that what God had promiſed he was able to perform. He was fully perſwaded. Where true faith is, there is not alwaies ſuch a ful perſwaſion that a man ſhal be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:159991:26"/>ſaved: but where true faith is, there is a fulneſs of perſwaſion that the things revealed ſhall be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed: But yet not ſuch a fulneſs as no further degree can be added to it, but ſuch a fulneſs, as there is no doubt nor fear of the contrary: As full aſſurance is oppoſite to an opinion: whereas an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is nothing elſe but an aſſenting to a thing with fear that it may be otherwiſe than it ſeems to be. In oppoſition to an opinion, Faith is a full perſwaſion, though it's not a ful aſſurance as it notes perfection. As for example. He that ſees a color may be ſo certain as he cannot be deceived and yet he may ſee it more cleerly than he doth. So a man may have more of the Grace of the faith of aſſent, yet that further degree doth not adde any further certainty of the object, but only of the degree of beleeving.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3.</note> And therefore in the Scripture, Faith is ſomtimes called ſeeing, and ſomtimes taſting. <hi>Taſt and ſee how good the Lord is.</hi> And ſomtimes hearing: <hi>My ſheep hear my voice.

And herein lies a very great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the people of God, Beleevers, and others. To others, the great things of the Goſpel ſeem to be as a ſtrange thing, yea as fooliſhneſs as the Apoſtle ſaith. And as the Apoſtle doth intimate in another place when he uſeth this phraſe, <hi>Why ſhould it ſeem ſtrange and incredible to you that God ſhould raiſe up the dead?</hi> All that the Goſpell ſaith
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:159991:27"/>till faith hath this work, is not only counted as a fable that is the Phraſe of the Apoſtle when he ſpeaks of them that preach Fables, ſuch things as are devices for ſome further end, and becauſe there are ſuch things but only uſed as a piece of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick to perſwade men to another thing: As there is no diſputing againſt ſenſe: A man feels it to be hot, and nothing can make him ſay it is cold; when he taſts the thing that is ſweet, nothing can make him ſay it is bitter. So nothing can make a man that beleeves, beleeve the things that are revealed to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. That is the meaning of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. That the ſpiritual man is judged of none. He may be cenſured of men for to be a fool, and by his own heart, and by Satan: What do you beleeve that God wil part with ſuch things unto ſuch a one as you are? Is it reaſon that the Lord of life ſhould die, &amp; be made a curſe for you? But though he may be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he cannot be caſt in his judgment; he cannot be perſwaded to the contrary, from what he receives from the judgment of Faith in the Word of God. <hi>The ſpirituall man judgeth all things and he himſelf is judged of none.</hi> There is a Judgment of cenſure and a Judgment of conviction. By a Judgment of cenſure a Beleever may be condemned of others, and condemned and checkt by his own carnall heart. As <hi>Sarah</hi> laughed when ſhe heard the news of having a child in her old age, in whom all the generations of the World ſhould be bleſſed. So a man is ready to laugh at himſelf for beleeving things which the Goſpell requires which are ſo much above reaſon. I ſay a man may cenſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and be cenſured by others. But with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conviction he cannon be Judged. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which the Apoſtle uſeth ſignifies ſuch a kind of Judgment w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> a man makes of a thing when he hath tri'd it in al the moſt exquiſite waies that poſſibly may be uſed. Such a kind of knowledg
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:159991:27"/>as a man hath of the matter which he hath gotten out of the confeſſion of another by torments and tortures. Do what you wil unto a Godly man and a Beleever, yet ſtill he holds that God is good, and that there are ſuch things in Jeſus Chriſt which the Goſpell reveals. Do what you will; Torture him with temptations, yet when he is himſelf he holds that. You may ſee this to be the nature of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith. Men that have but a common hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal faith, yet they beleeve ſo firmly as nothing can make them denie Chriſt. As we ſee by experience of many among the Turks who have nothing but this Faith, yet when they have liberty offered them from thoſe torments upon refuſing to own Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be God, yet they refuſe that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Specially you ſhall ſind thoſe that have ſtrong faith, they will hold the concluſion when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer the reaſon. As <hi>Job</hi> ſaid unto his friends, <hi>Job</hi> 27.5. <hi>He would hold his Integrity till he died.</hi> Let them ſay what they would of Gods dealing with good men and bad men, yet he would hold his own. Thou knoweſt there is no Iniquity in my hand ſaith he. So when a Godly man knows not what to ſay, yet he ſaith this is the word of God, &amp; that remaines Faithfull, and this is certainly true concerning Jeſus Chriſt, and cannot be queſtioned Nay, take thoſe that have weak Faith: As the Needle that is touched with the Load-ſtone, though it may be jogged, yet it wil turn again to the North. So though a weak Faith ſhould forget it ſelf, yet it will recant, and retract, and recover it ſelf again to the acknowledgment of the Truth. I ſhall ſay no more of this, but only thus much; That as he that hath drunk in an Opinion, is ſo prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the contrary, that he will not hear nor credit whatever is ſaid againſt it. So doth Faith preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Soul againſt any ill reports or falſhoods
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:159991:28"/>that can be raiſed of Jeſus Chriſt, or the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: As Faith doth this as it is an act of the Underſtanding; So it doth perſwade and lay argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before the Will, that it ſhould go unto Jeſus Chriſt for all theſe things which are revealed to be had in him. As <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.1, 2. ſaith to his Children, <hi>Why ſtand you here when there is Corn in</hi> Egypt? <hi>Go down thither.</hi> So doth this Faith ſpeak unto the Soul of a man. Why do you ſit weeping, and mourning, and lamenting your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What is it you want? If it be either Grace or Comfort, you may have it in Jeſus Chriſt. As the Angel did check <hi>Hagar</hi> for weeping ſo as ſhe did, becauſe ſhe was athirſt in the Wilderneſs, when there was a Well hard by: So doth Faith check the Soul when it lies moaning and complaining and doth not put it ſelf upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for a ſupply. What would you have ſaith Faith? If what you would have were not to be had, not to be had any where, or upon a rate that you could not give, then you might ſit down ſadly. But when it is but Take, and Eat, when it is but ſtretching forth the hand, and take of the Word of Life: Why do you not beleeve? As Jeſus Chriſt ſaid, upbraiding his Diſciples of their Unbelief, Why is it thus with you? You are troubled with an heart of Unbelief, becauſe it is dull, and becauſe it is dead, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are hurried with temptations, and you would fain be quick, and beleeving, and be at peace and quiet: Now go unto Jeſus Chriſt. Thus Faith cals upon a man. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.7. ſaith <hi>David, I bleſs the Lord who hath given me Counſell.</hi> Now God Counſels the Soul thus by the Revelation of his Word unto a man through Faith. In <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45. Faith is called a going unto Jeſus Chriſt. And as <hi>Joab</hi> learned the Woman how to go unto King
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:159991:28"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> So Faith learns the heart how to go and ſpeak unto God in the behalf of it ſelf. And this the light which is in his mind cannot but do. For you muſt know that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding doth naturally work by way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion upon the will. As <hi>Achan</hi> ſaid he ſaw the Babiloniſh garment and coveted it with the luſt of his ſoul, ſo the light that is in the ſoul by faith doth ſtir up a man much more to get it. The ſeeing of things by the underſtanding, cals upon it, and provokes it to apply it to it ſelf. We heard the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a merciful King, and therefore we ſay to him, let thy ſervants live. So the ſoul upon the report which the underſtanding makes unto it, goes unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ſaith, we have heard that with thee is Grace, and that thou wilt impute thy righteouſneſs, and take my ſins upon thy account, and that the ſpirit ſhal be ſhed abroad in the heart of them that come to thee, And therefore it goes unto him. Therefore ſaith the Text in <hi>John</hi> 6.45. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that hath heard and learned of the Father comes unto me.</hi> That is, there is none but do come. There is indeed a perſwaſion which the word makes, which may be reſiſted, but the perſwaſion of true Faith cannot. There is ſuch a Sicada, and Rhetorick, and ſuch an Emphaſis, and ſuch an aptneſs in all that faith doth reveal unto a man, that as it is ſaid in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.8. it doth compell a man to come in. Which compulſion there, is not meant of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall violence, but of the conſtraint of the word of God to whom it comes ſavingly. And becauſe of this perſwaſion it is, that the ſin of Unbelief, of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving out of Jeſus Chriſt, is ſo exceeding great where the Goſpell comes, becauſe men are wooed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and preſſed by the beſt and ſtrongeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And therefore there can be nothing elſe but a pure hatred, and not deſirous of the things
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:159991:29"/>of Jeſus Chriſt, which keeps a man from it. And that I may ſet forth this a little more cleerly unto your underſtanding.</p>
               <p>You ſhall find in the Scripture that faith is ſaid to give a kind of reaſon unto a man, and to take from him that folly and unreaſonableneſs whereby he ſtands in the way of his own good, and cannot ſee what is good for himſelf. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1.2. <hi>Pray</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the word of the Lord may have free courſe, and that we may be freed from unreaſonable men, for all men have not Faith.</hi> Unbeleevers are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable. And on the contrary, Faith brings a man to his reaſon. That when the word comes, an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever ſtops it, and ſaith, this Doctrine ſhall not be preached, and this is not the way of life, and counts himſelf as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, unworthy of eternall life by contradicting it: Now a Godly man grows wiſe, and ſaith, ſpeak this word, and whatever is hid and concealed, yet hide not this word of God. He goes and ſels all as it is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. that he may buy this pearl.</p>
               <p>And as Faith gives a reaſon to a man, ſo when a man is careleſs, Faith cals upon him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Hear and live.</hi> Will you loſe your ſouls, and your eternal good by loſing the opportunity? What ſhould you mind but the thing you are about? Hear what Jeſus Chriſt is, and what he hath done, and what he hath? Is there any thing like unto pardon, and like unto Union with himſelf?</p>
               <p>And when a man ſaith, It is true, theſe things are, But not for me. Faith anſwers, the things are near unto you, in thy mouth and in thy heart. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8. Do not ſay who ſhall aſcend, or who ſhall deſcend, &amp;c. The meaning of it is this, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Law doth require of a man duty, and gives him no power to perform it. the Goſpell gives him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:159991:29"/>as well a power, as it doth make known his duty. Thoſe things are impoſſible unto us which are far off, either in the Heavens or in the depths. But now ſaith the Apoſtle, whereas you ſay it is not for you, becauſe you know not how to beleeve it and cloſe with it, ſaith he, you have this both given to you, that you ſhall imbrace it and confeſs it. With the mouth man confeſſeth it, and you ſhall with the heart ſubmit to it. With the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves unto ſalvation. Why do you ſay it is not for you? You are in miſery by the corruption and depravation of your underſtanding and will: But ſaith Faith both ſhall be taken away. If that be the meaning of the place, as I conceive it is. But if it be meant of doubting as ſome conceive, Who ſhal eſcape the pit, and therfore who ſhal aſcend &amp;c. Faith tels a man, Never be diſquieted becauſe of that, for Chriſt came down and is aſcended. He came down and deſcended and revealed the will of his Father to us. When the Soul is going towards Jeſus Chriſt, then this Faith perſwades it ſo far as that it puts it into a reſolution. <hi>I ſaid I would go</hi> ſaid the Prodigall. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>We thus judg,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. A Judgment is a Sentence paſt after all is heard that can be ſaid on both ſides. A Judgment is the laſt act of the underſtanding after which there is no appeal not debate. Faith ſaith, I will hear no more doubts, nor aſſent to any doubts, ſuſpcions, nor fears. And when the Soul is ready to give over that work, then the work of Faith ſaith, If you withdraw your ſelves the Lord will have no pleaſure in you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. What though things go hard? yet you may live by your Faith. And as faith reveals the things that cannot be known by nature.</p>
               <p>So as it is a Perſwader, it brings to mind ſuch
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:159991:30"/>things which the Soul knew not before, Such things which are ſuitable to its caſe and its preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And that is the third thing whereby faith receives. It doth perſwade, and invite, and excite a man, that ſeeing there is ſo much to be had in Chriſt that we would not ſuffer it to lie ſtil and to be unuſed. There is another thing that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: It keeps the thoughts of theſe things thus revealed. It lets them not go out of mind, but ſets them continually before a mans face. As the underſtanding doth put a man to go to Chriſt and to him only: So it keeps Chriſt and the things of him in mind. It's as the Glaſs to ſet them alwaies before the face. As <hi>David</hi> ſaith in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. that his ſin was ever before him: that is, he could be in no Ordinance, but his Conſcience troubled him: And he could be in no company, but it adminiſtred cauſe of fear to him. His ſin was alwaies dogging him, accuſing him, and oppoſing him. So Faith ſets Jeſus Chriſt in his benefits before the ſoul in whatever condition a man is. Therefore you ſhall find in the Scripture that it is all one to beleeve, and to think upon God. <hi>I thought upon thee in the night ſeaſon, and I ſet thy loving kindneſs alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my face</hi> Pſal. 119.55. In <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Creator.</hi> It's not the bare having God in our memory, but it is beleeving that will ſave us from wrath to come. But beleeving is called Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance there. And on the contrary ſide in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. Unbelief is called a Letting eſcape. Take heed leaſt you let ſlip the things which you have heard. And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.4. thoſe that did not beleeve are ſaid to have the word of God piekt up our of their heart, As the Fowls of the Heavens do pick up the ſeed that is ſowen by the hand of the ſower, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:159991:30"/>are not converted by the Word. And Unbeleevers are called ſuch as forget God. Mark it.</p>
               <p>There are Two waies of keeping things in mind:</p>
               <p>One is by a Similitude, or Image, or Picture of it. Now to keep Spiritual things in a mans mind thus, is either but Natural Knowledg, or Superſtitious againſt the Second Commandment which forbids a man to make any graven Image of what God hath done, thereby to keep a man in thoughts of what God hath required.</p>
               <p>There is another way of keeping things in mind, and that is by the preſence of the things themſelves. Now this is the way by which Faith keeps a man and the things of Jeſus Chriſt, which is by way of Intuitive knowledg. Or it keeps things in a mans knowledg by the preſence of the things themſelves. And that is the ground why that Faith doth cauſe ſo firm an aſſent, and is ſo ſtrong a perſwader, becauſe I ſay the things themſelves are made preſent unto the ſoul. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.7. <hi>My Reins</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs me in the night.</hi> In the night when others ſleep: or in the night when I am free to conſider, and awaking, then thy Promiſes (ſaith he) they come into my mind. As Faith will not take any ſlight denial for anſwer, but doth convince the falſe reaſonings that are in us: ſo it wil ſlip no time nor opportunity of winning us. It doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually beliege the Soul, as I may ſay. The ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Fort may be taken in by a long Siege, when the Enemies riſe not from before it, but are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly battering it. Now Faith doth (as it were) batter the Unbelief and the Reaſonings of our heart with continual arguments to the contrary. Saith Faith to the Soul, You ſay thus, but hearken to what the Word ſaith: you ſpeak words of death, but God ſpeaks peace to his people. And you ſhal find by experience (which I ſhal leave as the proof of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:159991:31"/>this point) that that word which a man hath often times forgotten, and which he ſeems to have loſt, the operation whereof is ceaſed, yet a year or two, yea ſeven years after it comes to work upon a man again, and works him to that very thing which all this whil he ſtood againſt. Eſpecially when the time of a mans converſion is come, it's with him as it is with a Woman in her time of travell, that one throw comes upon the neck of another, until ſhe be delivered and ſees the Fruit of her womb: So there comes one argument upon another. And if one thought comes and ſaith, This is not for me, There comes another and bids him take heed that he puts not the loving kindneſs of God from him, and ſo it leaves him not till he be conquered. And that is the fourth thing to help a man to receive.</p>

                     <hi>A fifth work of Faith, as it is an Act of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is to aſſure and certifie a man of the things already received.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>Fifthly: Faith helps a man to receive of Jeſus Chriſt by making known to him the things freely given of God, by making known and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and certifying him of the thing freely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. As Faith tels a man what Chriſt hath, and what Chriſt will do, So it informes a man what he hath received from Chriſt, though that we come to know our particular ſtate by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. We ſay, we do beleeve, becauſe we find a deniall of our ſelves, and a loathing of our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and a prizing of Jeſus Chriſt, yet becauſe this that we find in our ſelves doth ariſe from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:159991:31"/>of our ſelves with the word of God therefore it is aſcribed unto Faith. My meaning is this. It is as well an act of divine faith for a man to conclude that he ſhall be ſaved, as it is an act of divine faith for to aſſert that he that beleeves ſhal be ſaved. This, That I ſhal be ſaved,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16.</note> ariſeth as wel from that word which opens the nature of faith, which I find to be in my heart, As this doth ariſe from the word, that there is none that beleeves ſhal periſh, but have everlaſting life. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. The Spirit of God is given us, that we may know the things freely given us. And this Spirit of God is the ſpirit of faith, as the Apoſtle cals it in another place. The ſum of the point is this. That the ſpirit of God doth by this Grace, or this act of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding make a man to ſee that he hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in poſſeſſion, that a great deal is paid down, that he hath received before hand. There is a pledg in his boſom: The Staff and the Jewels are left with him which Jeſus Chriſt will own. It tels him thus much when he ſtands ſaying in himſelf, Alas ſaith he, Why ſhould I go? Or why ſhould I, if I do go to Chriſt think I ſhould receive much from him? It tels him, you have received ſomthing, and he will give more: that which you have is but as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Star, which ariſeth before Sun ſhines: You ſhall be ſure you ſhall have theſe things, becauſe when you knew not, he put ſuch and ſuch things under your pillow, when you thought not, and ſought not, yet theſe things are done. Making known to a man that he hath received, doth ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him to receive more. For what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived is given as a pawn and pledg by God on his part, and it's a Motive and ingagement on our part to go unto him for more. As God will not leave his work imperfect, ſo we are bound to ſeek the perfection of it. There is a marvellous boldneſs
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:159991:32"/>and freeneſs, Nay, (that I may uſe the word of the Scripture) the Mouth is opened exceeding wide upon this, in asking things at the hand of God. It will go unto him and ſay, Lord thou haſt given me a penny, therefore give me a pound: Thou haſt given me a little, and therefore give me much: And this is ſtrong perſwaſion with God, for he cannot deny himſelf. He will never begin, but make an end. As a man that hath received ſomthing in part of payment, doth not only live upon what he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but he pleads his receits in Law: And he is inabled to follow the law by what he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: He urgeth the debt the ſtronger upon the Debtor by ſhewing him what he hath received. Thus when the Soul knows what it hath received by Faith, it goes and ſaith unto God after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; Didſt thou not do this for me? Didſt thou not when thou didſt for me at my firſt converſion tell me that theſe were but ſome of the Grapes of the vintage that I ſhould have? That they were but only to ſatisfie my longing, and were not all my portion? Haſt thou not by theſe things allured me to follow thee? Thou requireſt of me not to leave the things I have put my hand unto: The Lord will not do ſo much more; What is this little to thy fulneſs? What is my little but only a pawn of more? There is a great ſtraitneſs in the Soul till it comes to have this act of faith. The Soul doth take ſparingly, like one that ſteals, rather than one that doth receive his own, untill it comes to have this act of Faith. There is a kind of modeſty and ſparingneſs, It thinks it much to have a little. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that aſſurance keeps the Soul modeſt and humble, becauſe God gives it all in the name of Chriſt, It's not for us but for his ſake that any thing is given us: Yet aſſurance knows no bounds, and acknowledgeth no limits in receiving, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:159991:32"/>binds a man to take as much as he can, or as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate doth require. The leaſt degree of Faith doth give a man a capacity to receive ſomewhat from Chriſt, and this degree of faith doth give a man a capacity to receive it as his own.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you (by the way) think of this you that nouriſh your doubts, and that make much of your fears, that raiſe up this ſpirit continually in your hearts; You know not what you ſhould get if you were quiet, and what you looſe by your doubts. The aſſurance of your heart by faith is the inlarging of your heart to receive, and it is the key to Gods trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, where al his good things lie. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and try whether you have faith, and if there be in your underſtanding an indeavor to know more of the Myſteries of Chriſt, If you are going every day into a fuller and larger knowledg of the things he hath done for you, you are every day looking into the Ark, into the richeſt promiſes that you may ſee their extent. You have your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence continually telling you that theſe and theſe things are to be had in Jeſus Chriſt, and you ſit mourning for want of them, and therefore go and receive them: Do you find a Jealouſie leaſt you build upon the ſand? When you ſee a ſign the ſtraighter it is, the better it is, the more narrow it is, the ſweeter it is, and you put your ſelves upon the triall becauſe you would not be deceived in your ſelves: Therefore becauſe your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is ſo praying, and craving, and prying into the deep things of God, you may know your underſtanding is true, or your faith is true.</p>
               <p>There is one thing more which indeed ſhould have been the firſt in regard of order of nature, but I place it here, becauſe it is laſt known. And that is this.</p>

               <p>Secondly: The Anſwer or Effect of that work. As a Workman that makes a piece of plate, or any other piece of mettal that is ductile, or that may be beaten forth: his hammering of it makes it of that faſhion or Image: So Gods working upon a man to receive, makes him to receive. And the truth of it is, my beloved. That this doth alter our ſtate. For though we are diſtinguiſhed from men unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate by beleeving, yet our beleeving is diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by this working of the ſpirit. And though there be phraſes in the ſcripture which ſpeak of Chriſts dwelling in our hearts by faith, yet that whereby Chriſt comes to dwell and take poſſeſſion of us is his Spirit. We have more ſecurity of our perſeverance and continuance in the ſtate of Grace from this, that we are laid hold on by the Spirit, and wrought thereunto as ſaith the Apoſtle, and are apprehended, Then we have from this, that we do apprehend and lay hold upon Chriſt. Thy appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion were nothing, were it not for this, that thou art made to do this by him that alters and changeth not. And I ſpeak this to this very end, That though this work be never without a work of ours following of it, yet notwithſtanding the frame and habit of the ſoul, the diſpolition &amp; temper which we are caſt into by the Spirit through the word is unto a man a better ground, when he cannot act faith or when he doth act faith, it is a better ground than any thing elſe. It is a ground when he cannot and a better ground than any thing elſe: For Mark it. Thy acting doth but flow from this work, and cannot be made out to be good further than this is in thee. As we ſay in al other duties, The Lord looks to the heart; It is not the gifts, but the will with which we do any thing that God takes pleaſure in. So I ſay here, It's not any thing that I have mentioned concerning faith, But it is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:159991:34"/>that ſpirit of faith (ſo the Apoſtle cals it alſo) that frame of faith, An heart caſt into that mould, which makes al your acts to be accepted. If upon any act of ours (though thoſe acts were inabled unto by Grace) our ſalvation did depend, it might be hazardous. But it cannot be hazarded, There is no poſſibility of falling away, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of the Son, and of the Father doth work, and hath wrought us hereunto to beleeve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and will maintain that work. As a child (if I may ſo expreſs it) becauſe born of ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, hath a right unto the Eſtate, though it cannot plead, nor ſpeak to it ſelf. It is fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone. So art thou one Spirit with Jeſus Chriſt, when thou art thus ſhaped, and made to give up thy ſelf, when thou haſt a tendency of ſpirit to God in all thy hopes, when they heart and all within thee is unto Jeſus Chriſt, and thou takeſt all from him, as he ſhall pleaſe to give it thee.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If Faith as it is thus in the underſtanding, be a receiving, or there may be ſo much gotten from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt by the underſtanding and knowledg of him, then I beſeech you look unto the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. There is a double reaſon that lies in the Text, and in the Point that I have in hand. By it, you do receive as by a hand. And in it, is laid up, as in an houſe or barn or treaſure rich things from Jeſus Chriſt. It is his Cabinet, and your Honor, or it is your Treaſure-houſe. You have nothing to lay up the things of Jeſus Chriſt in, or you will not know where to lay them up, if you have not a mind to know him. Take heed to your underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, take heed what you beleeve. Errors in the underſtanding hinder you from the getting of faith.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:159991:34"/>We live in the laſt and worſt Age of the world, wherein men make no Covenant with their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. <hi>Job</hi> ſaid that he would do ſo with his eyes that he might not look upon a Maid: Yet that was lawfull: But there was a ſnare laid in it. Men keep not their thoughts from any thing that may be ſaid <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> againſt the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: So full of Adultery and unchaſtity are the minds of moſt that there is ſcarce any room for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to lodg in. Let me but tel you thus much that ſo much as you are ſtuft with the things that are not according unto truth, ſo much you keep out the things of the Lord Jeſus. If you do not beleeve the truth, you may be damned. So the Text ſaith in the ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 2.12. <hi>That they all might be damned, that beleeve not the truth.</hi> That word <hi>[All]</hi> is put in to ſhew both how great the puniſhment is of thoſe that do not beleeve: As a fire grows hot by having much tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: So the wrath of God is hot againſt ſuch kind of Men: It's an increaſe of coles upon them. God puts in <hi>[All]</hi> there, becauſe he would have men know how exceedingly he is provoked, and that he will do nothing for them. When Princes ſee whole Counties, and Cities in a mutiny, they take out one or two to puniſh, and not al. And to ſhew you that if God do not damn you for receiving the truth, yet you will be damnified for not receiving the truth. That is, you will be hindred. Take heed that you miſs not of receiving a full reward. Why what will hinder them? He reckons up the Errors of thoſe times (which are rank now as they were then) that men do not abide in the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. In 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>If any man come unto you and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not, Nor bid him God ſpeed,</hi> for this wil hinder your of receiving a full reward: And as the Apoſtle ſaith in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:159991:35"/>You ſhall be ſaved it may be, but as it were by fire, it will coſt you many an heart breaking, and many a frown from God, and many a ſob and ſigh, when God opens your eyes, that you ſhould be ſo careleſs of letting things into your underſtanding, which he hath made a place and treaſure for himſelf. Look you therefore unto your underſtandings. Me thinks this ſhould make a man very cautious, yea very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate againſt Errors, when he once underſtands that he muſt ſuſtain ſo great a loſs, and be hindred from ſo great a gain by it. As a man ſomtimes ſaith unto his friends, If it were not for you, I might have gotten thus much and thus much. Let me tell thee, If thou didſt beleeve the truth (which thou canſt not do while thy underſtanding is darkened through Errors) thou mightſt have gotten this and that from Jeſus Chriſt: for by beleeving in thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, there is a receiving of him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THeſe Acts of the underſtanding may ſeem not to be a receiving of and from Chriſt, for theſe may be in an Hypocrite. Hypocrites have their underſtandings inlightned, and aſſent ſo firmly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the things that are revealed in the Goſpell, as thoſe which are regenerated do. They are often times perſwaded, and affected with the perſwaſion of the word to go unto Chriſt. The Seat of Grace
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:159991:35"/>(it may be ſaid) is not in the underſtanding, for it's Grace which makes good, which no virtue in the underſtanding doth, for no man is ſaid to be good, becauſe he knows. Faith, ſo far as it is in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, is common as well to an unregenerate man, as to a regenerate man. The Objection is grounded upon theſe two things. 1. Becauſe the Scripture doth aſcribe unto Hypocrites and men that periſh, that they do beleeve. 2. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That is only to be counted a Grace which makes a man good, and no man is ſaid to be good for what he knows, but for what he doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe of this difficulty ſome have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the difference btween a regenerate and an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man only in the Wil: that a regenerate man approves, and an unregenerate man doth not, of the light that ſhines in him. But though that be true, yet the Scripture doth make a cleer and diſtinct difference between a regenerate man and an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, even in their very mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. As you may ſee in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, He that hath all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding which a man as a man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, he doth not underſtand the things of God, neither can he ſaith the text: But we have the mind of Chriſt. As the ſenſe doth only meddle with the things that are ſenſible. So reaſon and underſtanding in men doth meddle only with the things that are naturall, or with things that are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall in a naturall way. For as every thing is, ſo it works. So in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. You have the whol man diſtributed into ſpirit, ſoul and body. I pray God ſanctifie you throughout in ſpirit, ſoul and body. By the ſpirit be means the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as you may ſee by the like phraſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:159991:36"/>where he bids them be renewed in the ſpirit of their mind. And by Soul, he means the Will, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and by Body the outward practice and converſation. And in <hi>John</hi> 6.44. Our Lord laies the reaſon why ſome come to him, and not all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome were taught, and ſome were not taught of the Father. <hi>Murmur not among your ſelves, for no man can come to me, except my Father which hath ſent me, draw him, for it is written in the Prophets, You ſhal be al taught of God. Every one therefore that hath learned and been taught of the Father comes unto me.</hi> And in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.20. <hi>You have not ſo learned Chriſt.</hi> That word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, So, Imports a different apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in men of the ſame object Jeſus Chriſt. You have not So learned him, that is, ſo as ſome other men have, whoſe hearts are not renewed and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to walk according to what they know of him. If you do but obſerve it in that very place, the Apoſtle gives that as the reaſon, why ſome put off the old man with its deceitfull luſts, and others are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the new man in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, in verſe 21.22. <hi>Becauſe that they had not ſo learned Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It's a marvellous hard thing, I confeſs to aſſign the difference that is between the hiſtorical faith of him that ſhal be ſaved, and of an Hypocrite it's hard, but yet the Scripture makes a difference and diſtinction.</p>
               <p>In the general therefore, Grace or Virtue may be conſidered under a double notion.</p>
               <p>Either as it gives a power and ability to do good: And ſo Grace may be ſaid to be in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>Or Secondly: As Grace doth put that power into uſe, and inables a man to uſe that power wel. And ſo it's properly in the Will. For al vertuous acts muſt be voluntary, and therefore they depend upon the ſanctification of the affections. But though
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:159991:36"/>the uſe of this light in externall acts depends upon the Will, yet notwithſtanding this light in its ſelf doth differ from all other light. For it's a new one. (Bear with the Phraſe) for it's the phraſe of the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſaving Faith gives an intuitive knowledg of the things of God as they are in themſelves. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that lacketh theſe things:</hi> the word in The Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Theſe things are not preſent. It's all one with that of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. We behold with open face: And with that in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. where he praies that they may have their eyes opened to ſee what is the hope of their calling, what it is in it ſelf. For the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this you muſt know, That unto the ſight of the eye, there goes two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt: A Faculty and a viſive power. And</p>
               <p>Secondly: There muſt be light to diſcover the Object unto the eye. So unto the ſight of the mind, there goes theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt: Somthing which doth convey the mind of God, which the School-men cals <hi>Lumen deferens,</hi> Something which conveys things unto the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And that is the word of Scripture, The letter, Similitude, diſcourſe, and reaſonings wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one thing is gathered and concluded from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this anſwers unto the light which is in the air for the eye to ſee by.</p>
               <p>There is alſo <hi>Lumen diſponens,</hi> or a light which makes the underſtanding to ſee, or take notice of the things revealed, &amp; that is as the light of the eye. And this light which indeed is the light of Faith, it is infuſed, and comes not, nor is cauſed by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or ſtudy, or by deduction, or conſequence from any naturall thing, but ariſeth immediately
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:159991:37"/>from the ſpirit bringing the things of God and the Soul together. You ſhall diſcern it in that ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which the Scripture ſets it forth by, Taſting, and Seeing. Taſting; That as a man that taſts a thing, he hath it preſent with him, the ſavor of it, that there is no diſputing againſt it, or making him to beleeve otherwiſe. Do not you taſt it, ſaith he: So alſo the things of God are brought unto the ſoul ſo through the word by faith, that there is not a poſſibility for the ſoul to be miſtaken. That you may ſee a little into this, take the cleereſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of God in nature, yet you cannot thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that therefore God will do ſuch things, or that ſuch things ſhall be done by God for us, as Faith doth beleeve. Again, Compare earthly things and heavenly things together. Though that earthly things may ſerve to give you ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of heavenly, though that ſimilitude may ſet out things revealed, and keep them in memory, yet theſe ſimilitudes do not prove theſe things to be, nor can ſhew them in their own nature: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall find that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was partly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of regeneration, though that Chriſt had told him of it under an earthly ſimilitude of being born again. That ſimilitude did rather make the thing hard than eaſie: And our Lord adds, that, <hi>If I have ſpoken unto you of earthly things, and you beleeve not, how wil you beleeve if I tel you of heavenly?</hi> Joh. 3.12. That is, there are ſome things to be beleeved in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto ſalvation, that there are no things in the earth, to be compared to them: Therefore if you will not beleeve but by ſimilitude, you wil not beleeve them. You ſhall ſee what I aim at, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The knowledg or faith of unregenerate men may be reduced,</p>
               <p>Either unto diſcourſe, knowledg, or unto fancy, which is all one. Unto the congruity that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:159991:37"/>things that are earthly, and unto heavenly. I ſay you may either reduce it into diſcourſe. As for example. Men reaſon thus. Firſt, by way of cauſality, that if there be kindneſs in men, then much more in God that gave it. Secondly, by way of eminency, there is much more in the Fountain than in the ſtreams that are derived from it. Thirdly, By way of negation. If ſo be that this be not fit for a man to do, if man wil not be unjuſt, or forgetfull of the ſervice that is done unto him, then God will not forget the labor of our love, and the work of our faith, &amp;c. Now ſuch a kind of concluſion as this is, is not faith. I beſeech you mark it. It is not faith becauſe the concluſion is drawn only from a naturall principle, from that knowledg which we have of God by nature. This knowledg by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is naturall, and therefore this cannot be true faith. I ſhall only give you this for a proof of it, which is in <hi>James</hi> 2.19. <hi>The Devils do beleeve, and tremble.</hi> They properly do not beleeve as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by this, becauſe their Faith hath not thoſe effects, which true faith hath. But they are ſaid to beleeve, becauſe they have experience in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the truth of the word of God: They find that true to their coſt which God hath threatned: It is made good upon them, which God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the word. And again, they ſee by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that many whom they have tempted are gone to Heaven, and therefore they know that God will not fail nor break his word. Their Faith being raiſed only from their experience, that credit which they give to God, being only from what they feel &amp; ſee, is not good. Now al the faith in unregenerate men is of the ſame ſort with this faith of the Devils, for there is no more in the Child, than there is in the Parent. In <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>They are of their Father the Devill;</hi> becauſe they go no further than he is a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:159991:38"/>to them in. As the Children of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> are like unto him, ſo all the Children of the Devill are like unto him. And therefore as you may thus reduce, or analize their Faith unto light, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſo that faith which unregerate men have, is taken from the ſimilitude which earthly things have with Heavenly: They look upon Heavenly things through Earthly, as through a glaſs, and no further than that do they ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.11. <hi>To you</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>it is given to know the Myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, but unto theſe in parables, that in ſeeing they might not ſee, and in bearing they might not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</hi> Here you find a difference between the knowledg of the Myſtery, and the knowledg which men have by parables. Parables are nothing elſe but only the comparing of one thing with another, One thing ſet out by another. To have no more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg therefore of Heavenly things, than Earthly doth adminiſter, is for a man to have his eyes blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; Yea it is a Seal of the eternall wrath of God, <hi>Leaſt he ſhould be converted and healed by me.</hi> If it may be, yet more plainly to expreſs my ſelf. As in the worſhip of God, an Image or repreſentation made by man cannot help a man at all in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. So neither can the Image of Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things in Earthly ſimilitudes give us life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. You know that there are Innate princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Notions which are in every man by nature, of a Judgment, and of a God. Look what thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are unto natural things, ſuch a kind of innate principle is Faith unto the new Creature, which makes known the things of God by Jeſus Chriſt. It's not raiſed by diſcourſe, It comes not in by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it is infuſed, It lies there, and from thence it ſends forth its light into the Soul. You find the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> blaming the Teachers there, becauſe they teached in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:159991:38"/>of words, and he tels them that it was the means to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he faith of their hearts to conſiſt in man, and not in the power of God. His meaning is this, they heard the Goſpel preached Eloquently and Rhetorically: They looked upon Heaven as upon a Paradiſe or garden of pleaſure: They loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon Communion with God but only as friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of one with his Friend. The things of Chriſt were ſet out only by Earthly things as in a Map: All the Glory of Heavenly things were put upon them only by the reſemblances which they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Earthly things. If ſo be it be ſo good to be rich, and ſo good to have pleaſures here, then what is it to have good for ever, and the like. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tels them that al this would never make them Chriſtians, for their Faith muſt be in God, and this would keep them ſtil in the wiſdom of man. I ſhal conclude this Point thus. That as a man that knows a man only by his cloaths, takes another for him that is cloathed like him: So a man that hath the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of theſe things only by Earthly things, loſeth his knowledg or his fancy of them, as his fancy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>Secondly: The ſecond is this. Wherever this ſaving light in the underſtanding is, there it's joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with love in the Will: that is, the heart doth chooſe, embrace, take pleaſure and contentment in it: that is, it ſo takes pleaſure, as that it would rather have the truth than any thing: though ſomtimes in a paſſion, it may as wel quarrel with that truth, as it doth at other times quarrel with a luſt. But that I ſhall ſpeak more unto, when I come to ſpeak of the Acts of Faith as it is in the Wil, which now I ſhall betake my ſelf unto.</p>

               <p>FAith doth not only receive as it is an act in the underſtanding, but as it is an act in the Will. There are five ſeverall waies whereby Faith as it is in the Will doth receive Jeſus Chriſt and his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A fivefold act, Faith doth (as it is in the Will) put forth to the getting in of what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed concerning Jeſus Chriſt and his benefits.</p>
               <p>Firſt: There is a pious affection. Or it works a kind of liking of, and love unto Chriſt, and the things of him, as good and deſirable and real. That is the firſt thing. That whereas before the Soul looked upon him as an Enemy, or as one that was exceeding hard and auſtere, and it may be, as one that did but delude and mock, and intended not to give what he ſpake of and revealed; Now the ſoul begins to have better thoughts of God, and to think that he is kind and reall. And whereas before it looked upon the things of Chriſt as of no value, and cared not for the knowledg of them, now it ſels all to buy that Field wherein they are, it loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked before upon communion with God as not to be deſired in compariſon or competition with the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:159991:39"/>pleaſures of ſin. His favor and good will with the will of the fleſh he would have, but would rather leave God than leave his luſts. Whereas before he had no mind to mortification or deniall of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any thing, now there begins to be ſome liking of the things of Chriſt, and ſome kind of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ſo. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.7. <hi>My reins inſtruct me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the night ſeaſon.</hi> It's a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> which is a profeſſion of Chriſt, and a Picture of one that is made after Chriſt. You may ſee in that, how Chriſt ſuffered for us, and how we ought to be whatever our afflictions or ſufferings be for his name ſake. Now ſaith <hi>David,</hi> as one that is drawn after Chriſt, My reins inſtructed me in the night ſeaſon. The Reins are the ſeat of the affections and deſires. They inſtructed him: that is, they perſwaded him, and they began to work him into a better opinion of the waies of God, than before he had. Then I could ſay, ſaith he, <hi>The Lord is my portion, and my Lot is fallen in a good ground,</hi> and now God and troubles, God and afflictions are exceeding deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together, let the afflictions be never ſo hard. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. it's ſaid that <hi>Abraham</hi> did beleeve, and gave Glory to God. What is it to give Glory to God? It is to give a praiſe and commendation of his works unto him, which is to ſet out the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes lively which he hath put forth in any thing towards us. But ſaith he, he gave Glory unto God, that is, he commended God, and ſpake well of him, and ſurely (he ſaid within himſelf) he would never have ſpoken that I ſhould have had a Child, and not have done it, and he would not have made me beleeve that all the Generations of the world ſhould be bleſſed in him that ſhould come from me, unleſs ſomthing above nature ſhould be done for the bringing forth of him. He had a good opinion of God. Marke it. Though there hath been no
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:159991:40"/>parley, no agreement, nor match made between par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet we diſcern love between them upon their commending one another. So when the Soul begins to commend God, and cannot tel how to think ſo and ſo of God as Unbelief ſuggeſts, then he begins to love, and that indeed is a beginning of Faith. The Papiſts tell us that Faith is unformed, and as a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without a ſoul untill there be love. That is an error. For the formall act of Faith is in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to aſſent, which is not comptiable unto the will and affections. But in this ſenſe much might be ſaid concerning love, Though it gives not a Philoſophicall, yet it gives a divine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Faith: that is, it puts an excellency upon it. Whatever comes from Love unto God is thereby (you know) made more acceptable unto God. And this love or deſire of God is neceſſary both to make a mans underſtanding captivated unto the mind of God, &amp; to make the things revealed to become eaſie unto him. We eaſily beleeve that ſhall be which we would have be, and that man that gets our love, gets our truſt. That therefore is the firſt thing which Faith doth in the will, it begets a pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and liking of the goodneſs in God and the goodneſs that is in the things which are promiſed by him unto us. It's not (ſaith the Soul) I perceive now ſuch a hardneſs, and ſuch an ill condition to be married to Jeſus Chriſt, as I thought of before: It's not a way that brings with it ſo many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies as my heart ſupgeſted to me.</p>
               <p>But Secondly: As Faith is in the Wil, it doth approve and allow of that aſlent and credit which the underſtanding hath given unto the truth of the promiſes. I ſay it doth approve and allow of that aſſent which the underſtanding hath given unto the promiſes. The underſtanding ſaith, I do verily
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:159991:40"/>that theſe things are true, you do wel ſaith the Wil, hold you there, hold faſt that word, that is a word worthy of all acceptation, receive that rather than any thing. As a Steward lets a Leaſe unto a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and afterwards brings it to the Grand-Lord, and he takes cognizance of it, and gives conſent to it: So the underſtanding brings the promiſe to the Soul, and ſaith, I have beleeved theſe things to be true, and that they ſhall be accompliſhed; They are above Senſe and Reaſon, But I cannot but think bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they ſhall be; They are better than all things elſe: Now doth the Will give up it ſelf ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the liking and ratifying of this act. You have it I conceive fully proved in <hi>Phillip.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We are the Circumciſion which worſhip God in the ſpirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> We rejoyce faith he, and have no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the fleſh, the Apoſtle is there proving that a man cannot be ſaved by the works of the Law, but only by being found in Chriſt, Concerning this (ſaith he) we do rejoyce. As if he ſhould have ſaid, we are glad with all our hearts that we ſhall not go to Heaven by doing, but by beleeving, and not upon out own Legs, but in the Arms of Chriſt. It doth us good to the heart that there is no duty nor ſervice that ſhall be accepted, but only the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It is not our ſalvation alone which makes our hearts cheerfull, but it is this, that it is given by ſuch a means and hand as Jeſus Chriſt is. We rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the fleſh. As by approving ſin a man doth make ſin his own, and contracts the guilt of it which was done by another: So by the Wils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of the aſſent which the Underſtanding hath given unto the truths of the Goſpell, the Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a partaker together with it. Or thus: As a man that doth approve evill, will ſoon be full of all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:159991:41"/>unrighteouſneſs, So the will approving what the underſtanding beleevs concerning the truth of the promiſes will bring the Soul to be filled with the bleſſings of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: Faith doth make the Will to give up it ſelf unto Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore Faith is called a coming unto him: And in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. <hi>They gave themſelves unto God, and then unto us.</hi> You ſhall underſtand the meaning of it, if we firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meaning of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>[they gave]</hi> He that gives a thing alters the property of it, he makes him to be the Lord and maſter of it, to whom he gives it. This is yours do with it what you pleaſe, I call it my own no more. So now they gave themſelves unto Jeſus Chriſt, and reſigned themſelves unto him, and would no more meddle as before they had done in working out meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly their own ſalvation. I am not my own ſaith the Soul, I am thine, Lord I have no more to do with my ſelf, to ſave my ſelf, than I have to do with that which is another mans to uſe at my pleaſure: I have given my ſelf to thee. And as you may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the meaning of it by the word <hi>[Give]</hi> So you may by that which the Apoſtle joynes to it: They gave themſelves firſt to God and then to us. How did they give themſelves to the Apoſtles? They did give themſelves to them as their Teachers as thoſe by whom God would reveal the things of him, and the way of practiſing of the Will of Jeſus Chriſt. Upon this account you ſhal find that faith is compared to Marriage, where parties give over the right of themſelves unto another. Only let me tel you this by the way: That there is an implicite giving. As a man is ſaid to give himſelf to ſleep, and to idleneſs who doth indulge his own eaſe, and laies himſelf ſoftly: That is an implicite giving.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:159991:41"/>There is an explicite giving, and that is by way of expreſs reſignation: As a man that comes and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a poſſeſſion of goods, or a commodity which is bought into the hands of another: Here, take what is thy own. Now in al Faith there is an implicite gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but not an explicite. I ſay there is an implicite giving: there is an indulgence of it ſelf, and liking what may make it ſelf vile, and what may draw it unto Jeſus Chriſt, though it cannot ſay (as it is true to ſay) before all things I had rather, or do deſire to favor, and wil no more ſeek after the love of any other creature. The explicite reſignation is that which the Saints do come unto: But a man may have faith though he cannot ſay ſo of himſelf. This explicite Reſignation and giving a mans ſelf is neceſſary (but not as this implicite giving a mans ſelf is) unto ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: Faith as it is in the Will doth make a man to reſt and ſtay himſelf upon Jeſus Chriſt, and to look to no other means beſides him for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. To reſt upon him. This you have the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture oft times ſpeaking. <hi>Eſay</hi> 50.10. <hi>Let him truſt in the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> Somtimes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's called in the Scripture (as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.1.) a not fretting, but being quiet. This reſting brings in abundance from Jeſus Chriſt. I ſay it brings in: For if a touch of him be followed with vertue to heal: If one touch upon dead bones will make life come into the ſpirit, then what will the continued acts of Faith do? This is that indeed which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cals a life. In <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Becauſe, though there be many intermiſſions and interruptions, that a man doth ſo reſt as that he is beaten off, yet ſtill he comes unto Jeſus Chriſt again. That is his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral courſe, and that wherin alone he takes conent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In this caſe the Soul ſaith to Jeſus Chriſt in its carriage, I ſay in its carriage, juſt as a man uſeth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:159991:42"/>to ſay to one he depends upon, I wil look no where elſe, If you diſappoint me, look to it, I have no other friends to ſupply me, I have none to go unto for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief but you: So faith the Soul. And if it find its ſelf at any time carried to other things, and to reſt in them, then it is diſpleaſed with it ſelf, and troubled at it ſelf, and never hath quiet untill it makes that void and nothing, which it hath done before.</p>
               <p>Then Fifthly: As Faith is in the Will, it takes in what is in Chriſt, it applies it to its ſelf, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as its need and neceſſities are. I ſay, it takes in what is in Chriſt. Al the reſt of the acts of faith were but (as it were) carrying the ſoul to him; This now doth make it inriched by him. As the Cloath lying in the Fat doth receive the color and dye: Or as a man lying in ſin is thereby hardened and habituated to do evill: So the Soul by its reſt and continuance in Jeſus Chriſt comes to be made partaker of all that is in Jeſus Chriſt. It makes uſe of him to pardon and to ſanctification. When as it is afraid of wrath,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1.</note> it looks up to him: When it's beſieged with luſts it ſends for help to him. <hi>Without me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>you can do nothing.</hi> That is, Not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their being in him, but without their making uſe of him. Therefore in <hi>John</hi> 3.21. it's ſaid that he that comes to Chriſt, hath al his works wrought in God. Wrought in God; How is that? As he goes to God for direction, ſo he goes to God for ſtrength through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Let me add but this Caution.</p>
               <p>That though theſe five ſeverall acts be done by Faith as it is in the Will, yet you are not to think that they are done in that order that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them, or that they muſt be done to ſo high and notable pitch and degree before a man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, But there is ſomthing of all theſe wherever faith is; and ſome thing done of all theſe, though
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:159991:42"/>it be very weak: There is ſome love, though it be but a preferring of him to others: And ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, and yielding of its ſelf unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ſome reſting on him.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only ſay this one word of Application at this time, and that is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Faith be a Receiving (as you have heard) Then the ſin of Unbelief is exceeding great and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry provoking. As our miſery is great that we have not only no active power to do good, but we want a paſſive power to receive good. We are no apter nor fitter to any good work than the ſtone is fit for a building which can be laid in no place till the hand of the Workman comes upon it and ſquares it. So the ſin of Unbelief is great in this, that it is a denying to receive, or an hardening of the Soul, and making it uncapable as much as in it lies of the things of Jeſus Chriſt. What an abominable proud thing is it for a Beggar that he will not take an alms for himſelf that hath nothing to live upon, that he wil not receive a favor? Yet ſuch is the ſin of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, for Faith is a Receiving. Thou doſt as much as ſay in thy own ſelf, Thy acts of unbelief, have this voyce, Lord I will have none of that which thou offereſt; Keep it to thy ſelf; I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be without ſalvation than have it upon ſuch terms, by way of an alms or receiving; I wil work for it, and purchaſe it, and buy it, and not take it as a meer gift. What Prince is able to endure that the condemned perſon ſhould reject his pardon, and not take it: that he ſhould accept the halter and the block, rather than the Grace and favor ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to him. We think it modeſty and humility not to receive the things of the Goſpell that are ſo
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:159991:43"/>glorious: No: But becauſe that faith is a receiving, thou doſt throw all theſe things like duſt into the wind, and water upon a ſtone,: Thou wilt not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford God ſo much as a Veſſell to take in what fals from Heaven into the Souls of men. It is not thy modeſty, but thy pride. If thou haſt never ſo much, Canſt thou not receive a kindneſs? If thou be never ſo well, yet canſt thou not be better? Haſt thou ſo great an abundance, that nothing can be added to thee? Say all this if thou dareſt, and own it before the Lord: Thou muſt ſay it, if thou takeſt the part of unbelief, becauſe faith is a receiving, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is a rejecting.</p>

                  <hi>OBJECT.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUt it may be objected; That Faith cannot be both in the Underſtanding and in the Wil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Faith is a Grace or Quality, and therefore an Accident, and an Accident is proper but unto one Subject: As ſight is only in the Eye; and hearing in the Ear: So Faith is only either in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or in the Will; but not in both.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:159991:43"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer to this in brief.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Habit or Grace of Faith (in the firſt place) is one; Not ſimply and abſolutely but by Aggregation and Compoſition of many habits: As two may be in one act, So two habits doth make one Vertue or Grace. Many qualities may ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately concurre to the making up of one habit or vertue.</p>
               <p>It's opened thus.</p>
               <p>Beauty in the Body is a Quality, but yet it is compoſed partly of the proportion of parts, and partly of the healthineſs and ſoundneſs of parts.</p>
               <p>So, Liberality is a vertue; but it is compoſed of a good diſpoſition in the Will, and alſo of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in deſire after earthly things.</p>
               <p>So, Prudence is partly in the Underſtanding, and partly in the Will ordering a mans converſation. We find it by experience, that when we do believe we do both put forth knowledg, and alſo good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or an Act of the Will towards Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is a meditation of the Promiſes, and there is alſo a reſignation of a mans ſelf up to him that hath promiſed; This we find by experience when we do believe. And we find by the ſame experience that when we would beleeve we are hindred by the darkneſs of our minds; and when our Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are cleared yet we are hindred by the awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and indiſpoſition of our wils.</p>
               <p>Let us love one never ſo much we cannot truſt him except he promiſe; and not then neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we have an affection to him as to one that is faithful and true.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One habit is in one faculty formally but may be in divers by way of diffuſion and diſpoſition. The meaning of it is this. There is a communication or intercourſe between the Underſtanding and the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:159991:44"/>Will. One works into and upon the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the work of one is required to the work of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>As for example.</p>
               <p>Freedom or liberty is formally in the Wil, but it is radically or rooted in the Underſtanding; for the Wil were not free to chooſe if it had not a light ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing it the difference of things, what is good and what evil, what does come neer to, and wil not bring it the end that it aims at.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe you therefore (for I will not ſtand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting) that Faith be ſeated only in the Wil; yet it works into the underſtanding al the acts that I have ſpoken of, and is not without them. And ſo on the contrary; ſo that whether you read or hear faith to be in the Underſtanding or Will; make no great difference in that, for both ſhall be ſatisfied, and there is ſomthing to be done by both that you may be made partakers of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>So I have done with the Doctrinall part of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Uſe and Application of it. If Faith be a Receiving, then by this you may try whether you have faith or not. If you look into Scripture you ſhal find that the Children of God are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are not born of God by this, that the one receives and the other receives not the things of God. In the verſe before my text it's ſaid that Chriſt came to his own and his own received him not. Not to receive him and to be in darkneſs is all one (as you may ſee by comparing the verſe together) <hi>He came to his own and they received him not, but they that did receive him they became the ſons of God.</hi> By his own is meant the Jews whom God had choſen for his peculiar people and owned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:159991:44"/>the World; (All are Gods own by Creation, the fulneſs of the Earth is his; but theſe were Gods by a ſpeciall relation and obligation.) And they had received from him Laws and Statutes; and they had profeſſed peculiar ſubjection and obedience to him, ſo that they could ſay, We are thine, Lord ſave us; yet they who were ſo different from the World are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe that are taken out of the World and are the ſons of God by Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, thus, <hi>They Received not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So you have the Apoſtle uſing the ſelf ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. where he tels you that the naturall man does not receive the things of God neither can he, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: But we have the mind of Chriſt (ſaies he) So that I ſay, Receiving does diſtinguiſh the Faith that is unfeigned from that that is temporary and hiſtoricall.</p>
               <p>And as the Children of God are diſtinguiſhed by receiving, ſo whatſoever a man gets if not by Faith it's ill come by; Yea he doth become guilty like goods gotten into a mans poſſeſſion illegally. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7. Received you the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith? putting them in mind that if that Spirit (they thought they were of) came to them by the hearing of the Law, it were not the Spirit of the living God by which they could be ſaved. Therfore try your ſelves by this. Thou ſaieſt thou haſt Faith, Is thy faith a receiving Quality? Somthing that does enable thee to gape and gaſp? Does it open thy Soul (too) in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching after the things of Chriſt? In plain tearms, Is thy Underſtanding greedy of knowing? Art thou willing to give up thy reaſon to the teſtimony that God gives of his Son? Art thou loth to let the thoughts of Chriſt paſs from thee? Is thy Wil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining and tending to them?</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:159991:45"/>
               <p>Now for the making out of this, (and I beſeech you mark it) of ſome the Scripture ſaies barely thus much, <hi>That they received not Chriſt,</hi> They are ſhut up under that (As in <hi>John</hi> 1.11. the verſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my text) <hi>He came to his own, and they received him not.</hi> And, <hi>The naturall man receives not the things of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. Some beleeve not, and receive not but they are very neer it. The fruit is neer their mouths, the word (as I may uſe it) is not far from them. Plainly thus:</p>
               <p>There are ſome that are negative not privative Unbeleevers: That is, they are not Unbeleevers by way of oppoſition, but by way of omiſſion. They have not denied and ſaid they will not go out to Jeſus Chriſt, but, they are about the matter, and about the matter, till the things of their peace be hidden from their Eyes. Some Perſons are neither free, nor are they promiſed in marriage, but are in treaty ſo as they cannot admit of another to come to them: So there are ſome that hold Jeſus Chriſt in hand, cannot endure to think that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould leave them, and yet they come not actually off to the cloſing with him and receiving him in to their hearts.</p>
               <p>As there is a negative holineſs, the man can ſay I am not as this man: So there is a negative unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, when as it may be ſaid of men they do not lay hold or receive, but it cannot be ſaid of them that they do reject or refuſe.</p>
               <p>Sometimes this doth ariſe from unſenſibleneſs of the want of Jeſus Chriſt: Becauſe we are not ſenſible of our need of Jeſus Chriſt. And that (I take it) was the caſe of the hearers who are compared to the high way upon whom the ſeed fell to whom the word of God came and they minded it not; they gave it the hearing but they forgat it preſently.</p>
               <p>And ſomtimes it comes from being taken up with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:159991:45"/>lawfull things as they in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. would firſt of all go and do the works they had before them, and they would then come to the Feaſt. They did not ſay they would not come, but they could not come then.</p>
               <p>Or, 'ſpecially it comes from an unactiveneſs and ſlothfulneſs and liſtleſsneſs of heart.</p>
               <p>There is a kind of Condition of Soul that a man is like the Sea in a calme, that you know not which way it goes; A ſtillneſs there is or ſcarce any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that which is good. Think on it. Be it from what cauſe it will though it ariſe not from any diſlike or oppoſition to the things of Jeſus Chriſt, yet it is a dangerous Condition. A ſtill liveleſs ſpirit is as well a ſpirit in a dangerous condition as that which is hurried and carried violently with ſtrong temptations to ſin. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.30.31. One ſaies he wil go into the Vineyard; he granted it to be his duty, but he went not. The Lord gives us thereby to underſtand that there are ſome who periſh through not doing that which they have a purpoſe to do, and that which they are convinced is beſt to be done by them. He that ſaid he would go, and did not; You are not to conceive him to be one that plaid the Hypocrite, in promiſing to go and yet did not intend it; but in this, that he did not fulfill that which had gone out of his mouth. There is hypocriſie when a man is convinced, and does profeſs to do the good he does not, Upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count therefore you ſee there is a reaſon you ſhould examine your ſelves.</p>
               <p>But beſides; The Scripture does ſpeak of ſome that contradict the Goſpell and word of Faith. In <hi>Act.</hi> 13.45. the Apoſtle exhorts them to receive with meekneſs the word ingrafted that ſhould ſave their Souls. That does imply that there is an aptneſs in men to be provoked at hearing the Goſpell. How
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:159991:46"/>many are there are wiſe to evade and exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the compaſs of the promiſes? that if any thing come neer them to comfort them, by &amp; by ſome objection or other is made, that ſo they may be ſtil in their doubts and ſtil in their fears? In <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. It is ſaid they put away from them the Word of eternall life; even as a ſick man puts away the meat and ſaies he is not able to endure it; So they ſay, this is not for ſuch as they are, it is too holy for ſuch dogs. And as it was with <hi>Ammon</hi> when he had defiled his ſiſter <hi>Thamar,</hi> he thruſt her out of doors and bolted the door againſt her. So do men do with the things of Chriſt: put them from them and bolt and bar their hearts againſt them with a reſolution never to beleeve this while the World ſtands. God opened the heart of <hi>Lidia, Acts</hi> 16.14. ſhe would not open it, but he broke it open by his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Yea laſtly (my Beloved) There are that do trample under foot the things of Jeſus Chriſt, and inſtead of receiving of them, count them vile and not worthy eſtimation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. which by many is underſtood concerning the indiſpoſition of heart that oft times does befall one that is ſaved afterward. Now then; ſeeing there are ſome that do not receive; and ſome that do contradict and wil not receive but ſlight the things of Jeſus Chriſt; then try whether you have Faith or not, by your receiving.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer. A Godly man does
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:159991:46"/>oft times ſay nay to God when he wooes him to be ſaved, and yet afterwards takes it: Puts away the mercy which he is glad on with al his Soul even as a hungry man is of that food which when he was ful he laid by and would not meddle with. When a godly man comes to ſee what he hath done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing and rejecting and diſputing againſt the Grace of God, then his heart breaks, and then he does cloſe with that which he hath rejected. A Godly man doth eat up that which he hath formerly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Thou ſhalt not waſh my feet ſaies <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt: As if he ſhould have ſaid, It is not fit that the Lord of Heaven and Earth ſhould do any ſuch thing for ſo poor and vile a Creature as I am: But when Chriſt tels him, <hi>Peter,</hi> It is not the ſign but the thing ſignified that I ſpeak to, and if I waſh thee not thou haſt no part in me; then he cries, <hi>Not only my Feet but my hands &amp;c.</hi> He is now content that Chriſt ſhould do that in a great degree which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not abide to hear of in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The temper of a man that hath Faith (as conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under the notion of Receiving) doth diſcover it ſelf in theſe particulars.</hi> 1. <hi>He is daily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out corruptions, that there may be room to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Jeſus Chriſt. Particularly.</hi> 1. <hi>Confidence in the Fleſh.</hi> 2. <hi>Living by ſenſe.</hi> II. <hi>He is much in prayer.</hi> III. <hi>He is not ſatisfied till he obtain all which the Promiſe is engaged for.</hi> IIII. <hi>He laies hold on every intimation that may give hope, and thereby is raiſed to great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THerefore, to diſcover to you a little whether you have Faith or no; I ſhall in a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars ſet forth to you the temper of a man that hath Faith; and I ſhal keep to this notion of it, as it is a Receiving.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all; He that hath this Faith is daily purging and emptying of himſelf of every corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fleſh and ſpirit that there may be room to entertain and receive Jeſus Chriſt. The ground of it is this. Naturally we are ful of al unrighteouſneſs; (as a Veſſel is ful of water that can hold no more) there is no place for Grace. So far as corruption is in us ſo far it naturally works to take off the heart from ſeeking after Chriſt; Even as a Diſeaſe takes off the Stomach from meat that is wholſom: That therefore Jeſus Chriſt may be received it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the heart be daily emptied that there may be room made for him. But beſides that, Faith doth breed a hope and expectation in the Soul of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:159991:47"/>great things; and therefore Faith ſets the Soul on purging that ſo it may be capacious of thoſe things.</p>
               <p>Faith is called a Holy Faith. And we are ſaid to be ſanctified through Faith. In <hi>Acts</hi> 26.8. As the things that were ſanctified were ſeparated from common uſe to a holy one: So now the Soul that before was common; Common for the thoughts of the World, and for the luſts of the fleſh, Now is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated (if I may ſo expreſs it) to God. It is like a room that is lock'd up and kept only to lay the things of Jeſus Chriſt in. Grace does come into us, not as into a Subject for that is free and fit the receiving of it; but it comes into us as life comes into a dead body; Or as light comes into the dark Air. There muſt be firſt of all a putting out of the ſtrong man and of ſin, before there can be a putting in of Jeſus Chriſt. It's one thing to purge ſin out of us and to mortifie it becauſe it does keep good things from us; and another thing to purge it out that we may receive Chriſt in the room of it. A Hypocrite may purge out ſin becauſe it keeps out good from him; but not to this end, that he may receive Jeſus Chriſt; for naturally he hath no knowledg of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The naturall man perceives not the things of God, neither does he 'count them ſo good; for they are not ſo ſuitable to him as the waies of ſin. As a man to be eaſed of a bad and toubleſom neighbor, wil turn him out of doors and let the houſe ſtand empty: So, (rather than periſh) an unregenerate man will turn ſin out of doors, but he will not let Chriſt dwell there, for he will trouble more a great deal. A Beleever mortifies corruption that there may be a place, and room for Jeſus Chriſt and all that he brings with him. Therefore, as both the Underſtanding and the Will (as you hear) are active in beleeving: So, a Beleever purges both; the prejudices and falſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:159991:48"/>reaſonings that are in his mind, and the diſtaſt and carnalneſs of affection that is in his Will. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man he hath a combate within him but the combate is not between Grace &amp; Sin, but it is one faculty combating againſt another. The whol Soul does not ſtrive againſt ſin; but the Underſtanding would hate, but the Will (for reaſons) will not let him hate. So in like manner in mortification; An unregenerate man does not purge all the parts and faculties of his Soul, but ſome: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his affections are bad though he have light: and if his affections be hot, yet he hath not light in his Underſtanding. Therefore, Do you endeavor to cleanſe your ſelves from all corruptions? Does the hope you have of receiving Chriſt purifie your hearts, or put you upon the endeavor of purging your hearts daily?</p>
               <p>There are two particular ſins upon which the Grace of Faith (as it is receiving) does work to the ejecting of them: and the one is, Confidence in the Fleſh: and the other is Living by ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Confidence in the fleſh or in any thing a man can do: Therefore ſomtimes the Saints of God are afraid to lok back upon the actions that hath been brought forth by them in any beautifull manner leaſt their hearts ſhould be enſnared by them and they are abhorring themſelves even when their waies are pure, he abhors himſelf as to juſtification when he does the beſt duties in the beſt manner he can. We have no Confidence in the fleſh; that is, we would have none, we cannot endure that. Other ſins we fain would have mortified, but this above all other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And again, They live not by ſenſe. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>We walk</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>by Faith,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:159991:48"/>and not by fence.</hi> And we look not upon the things that are ſeen, but the things that are not ſeen, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. and the laſt. Of <hi>Abraham</hi> it's ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19. That <hi>he believed, and did not ſo much as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the barrenneſs of</hi> Sarahs <hi>Womb, &amp;c.</hi> The reaſon is this (my Beloved) Becauſe there is nothing can judg worſe of the things of God than fence; and nothing hinders more. When a man looks a little upon fence and reaſon, he is like a man that hath been in a dark room, that when he comes out, the light of noon day is a trouble to him, and he can not diſcern the things that are before him.</p>
               <p>Secondly: He that hath this Receiving Faith, he is a man that is much in prayer: Prayer demands and ſues for what the Promiſe obliges and makes due to a man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.4. <hi>David</hi> ſaies thus; I <hi>Pray,</hi> or, <hi>I give my ſelf unto Prayer.</hi> As we uſe to ſay, a man is of this or that Trade which he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows for the moſt part; and other things are but by the by which he does: So <hi>David</hi> was ſo much in Prayer, that he ſaies he was Prayer. And ſo <hi>Paul, Acts,</hi> 9. as ſoon as ever he began to beleeve, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to pray. And as a Believer does pray, ſo he praies upon the ſame tearms of Grace that he is a Receiver; that is thus; He is a Receiver for another, he receives nothing as his own prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and originally, but as it is a gift and truſt put into his hands by Jeſus Chriſt to uſe for the ſervices to which he hath appointed him. He goes therefore to God, not as one that is the Principal, but as one that is a Receiver for another: He goes with a Spirit that ſpeaks after this manner to the Lord; It is not for my ſelf alone, I am but the Meſſenger of Jeſus Chriſt, he ſent me; Jeſus Chriſt hath undertaken for me, and will ſee it made good to me, and I ſhal have it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: He that hath this Faith as it is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:159991:49"/>is unſatisfied with whatever he gets at any one time till he hath come to get all which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is engaged for and to him: And the reaſon of it is this: Therefore he is unſatisfied, becauſe he hath much to receive, and that which he hath received does but enlarge his capacity for more, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages him that he ſhal have it, as it is due: Even as meat gets a ſtomach to meat, ſo receiving gets an appetite to receiving. As preſumptuous perſons wil find ſomthing or other to encourage themſelves by; ſo, Faith (upon one reſpect or other) will ever be looking for, and after ſomthing from Jeſus Chriſt; upon one account or other it wil be ſtil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding. Art thou therefore applying to thy ſelf the things that are promiſed? Art thou challenging from God more than thou haſt? urging him upon his Word that thou haſt not ſo much as thou doſt hope in him for? Is what thou haſt received as a taſt that makes thy affections run out after more? Then know, that thy Faith is indeed a receiving Faith, a Faith of the Son of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: This Faith as it is Receiving, will take hold of every inſinuation and intimation, lay up every word that does give hope; and works up it ſelf by ſmal grounds (as one would think) to great expectations from Jeſus Chriſt. As a man that is trading takes notice of every thing that is ſaid or ſpoken hopefully of getting more than he hath. As there are ſome ſpirits that are ever gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing upon one; give them once, and they wil come again. Or, as ſome Children, that when they have received ſomthing from their Parents, they have their Eyes continually upon them looking for more. Such is the frame of the Spirit of one that beleeves, as it is a receiving; Faith makes a man to do ſo. And therefore you ſhal find by experience, that words ſpoken by the by, often times in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:159991:49"/>yet are the great encouragements, and hearte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſupporters of the hearts of Godly People. Faith is of that having, craving, growing nature, that if it can but get a word, it will make a great matter of it, ſin makes us greedy of occaſions to it; As a word or a ſillable hath great provocation in it unto ſin, ſo hath a word that is ſpoken but by the by, a great efficacy upon the hearts of them that beleeve: Thou complaineſt thou haſt not what thou didſt look for, becauſe thou doſt complain it is a ſign of thy Faith. Thou wouldeſt have that which thou haſt not; and Faith is a receiving.</p>
               <p>Then ſeeing both Underſtanding and Wil, ſtretch forth their hands to receive the things of Jeſus Chriſt; Beleevers they have a rich, and plentifull Condition. Their hands it's true are full of work they have much to do; but they have much to get in too. What they have a mind to, they ſhal have; and what they know or is revealed to be in the hand of God to do, ſhall be done for them. Their Underſtandings and Wills (let them be extended and enlarged) they ſhall both of them be filled full. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.19. <hi>He will fulfill the deſires of them that truſt in him.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>NOw I goe to another Uſe. If Faith be a Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, then if you would have Chriſt or any thing of his, you muſt beleeve, If you would have Chriſt or any thing of his, I ſay, you muſt beleeve. The Uſe lies upon this, that Faith is not only a Receiver, but the only Receiver which God hath appointed and ſubſtituted. There are other Graces which God gives beſides Faith, but he gives this vertue (to none) of laying hold and Receiving, but only unto Faith. Love that doth joyn the Soul to Chriſt and unites it, but Faith receives and takes of the fulneſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt. In <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.7. ſaith <hi>James, Let not ſuch a man think</hi> (that is, ſuch a one who asks not in faith, but wavers) <hi>that he ſhall receive any thing at the hand of the Lord.</hi> This wavering the Apoſtle doth oppoſe unto Faith. And yet he that hath this true Faith may have this wavering in ſome particular acts, though not in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:159991:50"/>frame of his ſpirit. As in <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.31. Chriſt ſpeaks unto <hi>Peter,</hi> and tels him he was one of little Faith, and asks him why he doubted? And the word that he doth uſe there <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifies a being between two opinions, a halting as it were, or an uncertainty of mind not knowing what to do, whether to receive Chriſt, or not to receive him, or whether not to receive Chriſt, or to receive him. In particular acts there may be (I ſay) wavering in a man that hath true Faith: But while he is ſo, let him not think that he ſhal receive any thing at the hands of God. We are wont to ſet other things beſides Faith to be our Receiver. As the Papiſts, ſo do we put good works unto the work of Faith: They think, by good words we do apply Jeſus Chriſt and his benefits. Mark it. Though there be much due unto thee from the Promiſe, though thou haſt God ingaged to thee deeply, yet wil not God give thee any thing by the hand of any other Grace but only Faith. God wil pay what he ows, but he wil pay it through beleeving. Therefore the Text runs expreſly, <hi>He that beleeves not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16.16. that is all he muſt look for at the hand of God. <hi>He could not do any great work</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>among them, becauſe of their unbelief,</hi> Math. 13.58. No great works. The meaning of the place is this, that God doth do unto men according to their Faith. <hi>According to thy Faith, be it unto thee,</hi> Math. 9.29. As mens Faith is, ſo ſhall their receiving be. If their Faith be mingled with unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, their receipt ſhall be but ſmall. Where there is a totall unbelief, their receipt ſhall be nothing from God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OBJECT.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you wil ſay unto me, as it is ſaid in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. <hi>If we beleeve not, yet he remains faithful, and he cannot deny himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:159991:51"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I anſwer, If we beleeve not, that is, if we beleeve not ſome particular Promiſe, and at ſome particular time, God will abide faithfull: for if you obſerve the place, it ſpeaks concerning ſuffering times, and this Promiſe, viz <hi>That if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo raign with him.</hi> A man may come to the ſtake, and to his Grave, and yet notwithſtanding want a perſwaſion of this. A man may dy by his act of affiance, and yet have no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of what aſſiſtance he ſhall have in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: But if a man beleeve not, that is, not at al, then nothing is due unto him. Mark the Text again. God ſaith he is faithfull. Therefore his faithfulneſs ſuppoſeth his Promiſe. And his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſuppoſeth our Faith: for he is ingaged to none but to them that beleeve. Therefore though God abides faithfull, yet the meaning is, though we queſtion this and that at this and that time, yet if our hearts remain faithfull to God and his name, we ſhall receive the things that are promiſed. Therefore let me ſpeak unto you, and unto you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that can ſettle upon any work, but the work of beleeving, that are eaſily perſwaded that the Promiſes belong not to you, nor the mercies which are ſaving, with a ſmall hint and inſinuation you are diſcouraged and diſheartned: Let me ſpeak unto you that are ready to deprive your ſelves of every ſweet morſell which the hand of the Lord reaches out to you, who ſay within your ſelves, when I am thus, and can do thus, then I will beleeve and go unto Jeſus Chriſt. You muſt come unto this (if you wil have any thing from the hand of Jeſus Chriſt) to beleeve. You muſt lay down your reaſon and your ſenſe, and you muſt put your ſelves to this queſtion.</p>
               <p>Ask thy own heart whether thou wouldeſt have Jeſus Chriſt or not? If it would have him and the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:159991:51"/>things that are his, then tell it, that it muſt beleeve, for there is no way to receive, but by beleeving. Therefore let me give this counſell to thee, Spend that time in drawing and urging thy Soul to go to Jeſus Chriſt, which thou doſt in diſputing thy right and title, and in anſwering objections and doubts. In ſtead of making out a reflect act of Faith or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, go directly unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And mark the reaſon of it. Faith it gives a title and the poſſeſſion of the inheritance. It's a receiving. Now mark. Be ſure thar thou haſt a right: If thou haſt a Faith that is alwaies having and craving and longing and hankering after the things of Jeſus Chriſt, it is right.</p>
               <p>And again, Though that every Commandment of God be to be obeyed, and none ought to be more carefull of holineſs than he that is juſtified by the righteouſneſs of another and by the Faith of Jeſus, I ſay none ought to be more carefull of a holy life than a Beleever, yet ſpend thy time (mark what I ſay) and thy ſpirits firſt in receiving and getting Jeſus Chriſt. Go not this way to work, when thou findeſt thy ſelf to be ſo and ſo, then thou wilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; becauſe thou art holy, therefore thou goeſt to Jeſus Chriſt, But go to Jeſus Chriſt that thou maieſt receive holineſs from him, for Faith is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. As eating a mans meat, takes up a great deal of time, yet there is no time loſt, becauſe it fits a man for his work afterwards. So the fitter thou wilt be to all the works of ſanctification, the more time thou ſpendeſt in receiving and eating of the things of Jeſus Chriſt. It is wiſdom firſt for a man to get in a fulneſs, &amp; afterwards to live anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable unto it. Why doſt thou think of thy ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation when thou haſt not received him that muſt make thee holy? Aſſure thy ſelf, it cannot be but al the things thou goeſt about will grow dead becauſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:159991:52"/>thou haſt not wherewith to maintain them. Al thy motions are but like a Wheel, which is hurried by a violent motion, but having no ſpring in its ſelf, in a little while it wil grow dead. And aſſure thy ſelf that thou ſhalt not lay a ground of Faith by doings. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may lay a ground of aſſurance, but not a ground of receiving, or going unto Jeſus Chriſt. It is true, Many things are to be done, as well as beleeving when a man would receive. A man muſt ask, that he may receive, <hi>John</hi> 16.24. And a man muſt be mortified that he may receive. <hi>Ye ask and receive not, becauſe you ask to ſpend upon your luſts,</hi> Jam. 4.3. And a man muſt be humble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God giveth Grace to the humble.</hi> And the Ordinances muſt be attended, even every of them, for it oft times fals out, that that Ordinance which is neglected, is that by which God will convey himſelf. But the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are but the Veſſels in the hand of Faith, they are but Buckets which Faith doth let down, or but Breaſts which Faith doth ſuck. The Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, is ſtill by Faith. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. And therefore the word profited not, becauſe it was not mixed with Faith, And the Text ſaith, <hi>If they praied and beleev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, they ſhould then receive.</hi> It's true, there are a great many Graces that muſt be in the man that receives any thing from Gods hands, but they are all but the attendants of Faith: They are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto Faith, Not for reception, but by way of preſence: As the Eye alone ſees, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee unleſs it be joyned to the other members of the body. So Faith receives, though it never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, but when it is joyned with other Graces. Whatever Graces are required unto Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith will help us unto. To pray acceptably. If we are to pray with humility and ſubmiſſion, Faith will help us to it. When once Faith is infuſed it doth
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:159991:52"/>diſpoſe and inable the heart to every thing that God requires.</p>
               <p>Beſides you know how a man that is touched with covetouſneſs and the love of the world wil bow down himſelf and deny himſelf much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come baſe that he may heap up riches together. So wil a man when he hath once gotten Faith. He wil pray earneſtly, and go from ordinance to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and ſubmit to any condition that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Jeſus Chriſt require at his hands that he may ſerve God and be ſaved. And therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and again I ſay, If you wil receive any thing you muſt beleeve, elſe there is no way for it. If you wil ſtand reaſoning and diſputing and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and if you wil have things cleare to you that you are a child of God, before you beleeve, you wil have the matter put to ſuch an iſſue as God brings a man never into. God never gives his love to a man, but by beleeving, becauſe beleeving is a receiving.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>OBJECT.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You wil ſay unto me, This is hard quarter, and hard termes, that we can have nothing but only upon truſt and upon beleeving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer the commandment of faith is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo hard as the commandements of ſin are. <hi>They that ſow to the fleſh, ſhal</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>of the fleſh reape Corruption.</hi> They ſhal never have any thing in hand or to receive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life, but tribulation, ſorrow, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Thy faith aſſures thee, Or thou mayeſt be aſſured that faith wil give thee a good title, &amp; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing while thou liveſt, and be ſure to give thee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glory and immortality hereafter. <hi>Thou</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:159991:53"/>art ſaved by faith, ſaith he, It is the gift of God. This is true indeed, It is a hard matter to beleeve. But the hardneſs doth not ariſe from it ſelf, but from us. As it is hard for a ſick man to get down either meat or medicine. But it is not becauſe there is neither a paſſage open and free, or not becauſe the meat is not good, but becauſe he is ſick. So thou ſhalt find the reaſon of all this difficulty to be in thy pride: Thou advanceſt thy reaſon and ſence againſt the commandment and law of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And therefore it is hard unto thee. It is hard, but it is but ſo in the beginning, Like meat, when it is firſt eaten, doth bring a kind of dulineſs, &amp; heavineſs but afterwards breeds ſpirits and ſtrength. It is certain my beloved it is the ſmalleſt thing that can be required for the receiving any thing at the hand of God: for you are paſſive in it, you are made to receive. As a bal that is thrown againſt the ground is made to rebound upwards. There cannot be leſs required then faith to the receiving of any thing. For,</p>
               <p>Take it as it is in the underſtanding: The recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a teſtimony doth not ſo much require the uſe of reaſon, as a good report and eſteem of him that ſpeaks. I ſay, the receiving a teſtimony is an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial argument, and requires not ſo much the knowledg of the things, as of the perſon ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>And Take it as it is in the Wil: and it is a leaning: and that rather imports weakneſs, then ſtrength, rather debility, then ability.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, Whereas thou complaineſt it is hard to beleeve, yet if faith be a hard thing, yet it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving. Though it be a toyl and a difficulty, It is but in taking of things that are precious and good
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:159991:53"/>which wil inrich thee. What man ever complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the hardneſs of telling Gold, and receiving Jewels and things of worth which were given him out of the treaſure of him that is rich. Men take great toyl, and run great hazards into far countrys to receive. Thy receiving is better and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Thou ſhalt receive ſtrength by the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt, to receive more. Faith doth not only give a man the things promiſed, But as walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing makes a man able to walk, ſo beleeving makes a man more able to beleeve. Having once received ſomthing from the hand of God, thou haſt thereby ſecurity given to thee that thou haſt nothing behind but what ſhal be accompliſhed. As he that hath received but part of a Sum, hath an evidence there by that the reſt is due. And therefore I beſeech thee, becauſe that faith is a receiving, incourage thy ſelf unto beleeving: Incourage your ſelves unto it. And that you may do ſo,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Lay open and keep before the eye of your Soul the many and glorious things which are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Meditate upon the excellencyes of Chriſt &amp; the portion that he brings: His portion: Both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of relation, ye ſhal be the ſons of God: And his portion in regard of eſtate or inheritance, for al things are yours. The preſence (you know) of an object doth ſtirr up the faculty and the power in it, which lay (as it were) before dead and ſtirred not. <hi>Joſhua.</hi> 7.21. <hi>I ſaw</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Achan) <hi>the Babiloniſh garment, and I luſted after it, and took it.</hi> As Sin prevails by its preſence: So the way for Jeſus Chriſt to prevaile, is to ſtand continually before thee. When thou haſt therefore looked unto the promiſes, and looked into the ſtory of what is ſaid concerning Jeſus Chriſt, and what he wil do for thoſe that are united to him, Then come and aske thy own foul, whether it wil have none of theſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:159991:54"/>Then come and tel it that al theſe are to be had, and it may take of them freely, though it can do nothing for them, nor returne ſuitably to them. The Apoſtle (to get men unto faith) ſpreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad the Goſpel and the things of Jeſus Chriſt. Thou muſt preach unto thy ſelf the ſelf ſame doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine if ever thou wilt beleeve. Thy ſins be before thee, and death is before thee, and hel is before thee: And thou ſeeſt by experience that that takes up thy thoughts and thou canſt do nothing elſe but only lament and bemone thy condition. If thou ſet'ſt Jeſus Chriſt before thee alſo, thou wilt be as much taken with him. For certainly there is more Taking in his excellencies, then there is cauſe of terrour in the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And again, Since faith is a receiving, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thy ſoul that it cannot live, nor be, unleſs it hath theſe things which faith helps unto. Pardon muſt be had. Juſtice wil not be ſatisfyed though thou ſhouldeſt fulſil al the commandments of God to the utmoſt, and never breakeſt them in the leaſt. Al that is due for the preſent, and there ſtil remains an old ſcore for the time paſt that God wil reckon with thee for. Thou art not able to make God amends of thy ſelf. Live of thy ſelf, thou canſt not, therefore thou muſt receive. <hi>Acts,</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is no other name given under heaven whereby a man can be ſaved, but only the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> And if a man (peradventure.) wil be loth to take of others as long as he hath wherewith in his own hands, or his friends hands, But when he ſees he muſt either take of alms, or ſtarve; and go on begging, or die, Then he wil go. That is thy caſe. Thou muſt receive from Jeſus Chriſt, or Starve. And thou canſt not receive the things of Jeſus Chriſt but by beleeving. As a Parent ſaith to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:159991:54"/>a Child that is peeviſh, and untoward, and that will not eat his meat; Faſt, ſaith he. So there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be looked for from Jeſus Chriſt if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveſt not, but fiery Indignation. And if thy heart would go to take contentment in the things in the World, Say to it, Now take Jeſus Chriſt, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. What good will they do thee unleſs thou takeſt Jeſus Chriſt? For they will not abide in the latter end, but then thou wilt have ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider that nothing is required of you, but meerly beleeving. I reaſon thus:</p>
               <p>If Faith receives al, then you muſt not look to have Grace without Faith: but to have Grace, by Faith. In order of nature, Faith is before them, and your eye muſt be moſt upon that, and your care of that. As the Text ſaith in <hi>Math.</hi> 6.33. that if a man ſeeks the Kingdom of God all other things ſhall be added together with it. So I ſay, if you look after Faith, your heart will be humble, and ſtoop to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which Faith reveals to you, and you will part from all ſins which have ſo great a place and intereſt in your affections.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly: Lay the Commandment of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſelf. This is the Commandment of God that you beleeve, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. This is the charge of God that you take and receive, and drink of the Water of life freely. Be thou what thou wilt be: Thou art under his Commandment. If thou art not, what needeſt thou fear his threatnings? He wil do nothing unjuſtly, He will puniſh none but his Subjects. If thou art his Subject, then thou art bound to obey.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:159991:55"/>
               <p>Object. <hi>Thou wilt ſay thou art ſinfull and vile above meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But will thy ſinfulneſs exempt thee from Obedience? This is his Commandment, that you Beleeve, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. Therefore come in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the great God, and ſpeak unto thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and ſay, Conſcience, I charge thee in the name of the great God, whoſe wrath thou trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt at, I charge thee in his name to go to Jeſus Chriſt and beleeve. What wicked hearts have we, which needs ſo much perſwaſion to receive, when we die if we do not receive? How much ado is there with our hearts? How much are men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by their hopes to receive? Saith Chriſt unto his Diſciples and Apoſtles, <hi>Go and ſtay at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, <hi>and you ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 1.4. And yet for them to go to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> was to go into the Lyons Mouth, and into the fire as it were, where their greateſt Adverſaries were: But they will go that they may receive. That was but the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt: And this is the Grace and fellowſhip of the Holy Ghoſt. Know, when thou art once a Beleever, thou art put into the Paradice of God, wherein all the Trees of God are full of Fruit, and thou maiſt pluck where thou wilt. Faith is a Receiving. Know, that when thou beleeveſt, God turns thee looſe into his Treaſury, and bids thee take where and what thou wilt. Take the Covering or Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to cover thee. Take his Spirit for guiding and directing thee. The Lords Supper runs by way of Commandment, Take, and Eat. As if he ſhould have ſaid, If there be any thing in Jeſus Chriſt better than another: As a man ſaith at a Feaſt, If there be any thing you have a mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:159991:55"/>you have leave to take; forbear it not: So the Lord commands you to take and eat. This is your Condition. A man encourageth himſelf in the World with this, That though he ſpends many hours, and much time, yet he ſhall get that with which he ſhall do good at laſt. Many a man is drawn by this, That when he hath gotten this, then he may attend, and do good. Let the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perſwade you to beleeve: That if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, you ſhall receive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay unto me, <hi>I have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and yet not received, but I am barren and empty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thou ſaiſt thou haſt not received. God ſaith otherwiſe: <hi>Every one that asks, receives, Matth.</hi> 5.42. And Faith will not ſpare for asking. For in the Scripture, in one place it is ſaid, <hi>He that beleeveth, ſhall not be confounded,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.6. And in another place it is ſaid, <hi>He that calls on the Name of the Lord, ſhall not be confounded,</hi> Rom. 10.13. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Faith will be crying and asking. As ſoon as it is in the heart, it will cry as a new born Babe, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. Every one that asks, receives, ſaith God; and thou wilt be judged by thy own heart and mouth. As he ſaid to his Diſciples; You have been with me ſo long, and have you wanted any thing? No, ſay they. So let me ask thee this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; When didſt thou ever beleeve, and hadſt not hope in him? When didſt thou ever truſt in him for any thing, and that he did not make it good? Did he ever diſappoint thee? But</p>
               <p>Secondly, There are divers waies of Receiving. A man may receive an Eſtate by receiving Security of that Eſtate, when he hath good Bond, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons bound unto him for it. Hath not God given
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:159991:56"/>thee his Son? And hath not God ſpoken unto thee through a promiſe, and paſt his word that thy Heart hath been inlightned, inlivened, and cheered in the Meditations of it?</p>
               <p>A man may receive you know by way of equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. As for example. If a man doth not receive ſo much in ſpecies, in money, yet he may in worth, in Jewels or other things that wil amount there unto. Do but look over all thy ſmal Sums, all the many mercies which thou haſt received, And ſee if they amount not to what thou hopedſt for? It may be thou haſt asked comfort, and God hath given thee Grace. This was but a bill of exchange. Thou haſt asked that God will fill thee with joy, and God fills thee with humbleneſs. Here is but an Exchange. Thou haſt received all this while. It may be thou wouldſt fain have Gloried in him, and it may be God gloried concerning thee. As God ſaid concerning <hi>Job.</hi> There is not ſuch a man in the whole Earth. God may ſay of ſuch a one, though he hath nothing but Tears to Eat, and nothing but Bitterneſs and Anguiſh and Sorrows, <hi>Yet he loves my waies.</hi> Here is a receiving. Know that Faith is ſuch a receiving, as a man that receives an infection, which he doth not feel for the preſent, but it may be he feels afterwards. And the Reaſon is this. Becauſe that Faith principally receives as it is an act of the will. And if it did receive principally as it is an act of the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, then a man could not have any thing, but he ſhould know it, or be near the knowledg of it. But ſince that receiving is by the will, he muſt have the ſpirit of God to make known to him the things that are freely given him of God. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p>Now having anſwered this, I beſeech you, Lay both hands (underſtanding and will) upon the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:159991:56"/>Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Gather in with both faculties. Reſt not til your underſtanding be filled, and your will be ſatisfied. What ever it is which you want, Chriſt hath. What ever you would have from him, you muſt either have from him upon price or merit, And you have none: Or you muſt have it upon gift. Either you muſt receive it as an almes, or as a debt. A debt it is not to you, but only as you beleeve. When you do receive it as an almes by Faith, it is ſweeteſt, and you ſhal receive moſt. The caſe ſtands thus. Either you muſt yield to God, or God to you. It is fit you ſhould yield to him. Why ſhould not the Ciſtern receive from the Fountain? The Creature from the Creator? It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with his honor to yield to you, that is, upon any other tearms to give you any thing, but barely as an almes. If you will not part with your honor, (as you muſt, if you do beleeve) know, God will not part with his honor, as he muſt, if he gives any other way then by beleeving, for Faith is a receiving. And it is fit he ſhould uphold his glory as the Fountain of all that good which the Creature hopes for,</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Receiving denotes Paſſiveneſs. This proved as to beleeving. I. In that Faith is not of or from our ſelves. II. In the very act of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are inabled by God, we act as little as poſſibly can be. This appears if you conſider.</hi> 1. <hi>The oppoſition which is in us to beleeving.</hi> 2. <hi>The Nature of Faith it ſelf. And that as it is an act either of.</hi> 1. <hi>The underſtanding. Or,</hi> 2. <hi>The Will.</hi> 3. <hi>Who are beleevers.</hi> 4. <hi>Even the Saints are ſenſible of a power making them to beleeve.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have already as you may remember ſpoken of Faith, as Receiving doth import and imply a getting an actual poſſeſſion of that which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and gave unto us in the purpoſe of his Grace through Jeſus Chriſt. Election gives all. The promiſes declare what is given, and ingage God to make it good: And Faith receives all. In Election God reſolves what to do for us: The promiſe gives it under his hand: And Faith puts it into our hands. Of this I ſay I have largely ſpoken, and ſhal repeate nothing, but go on to what remains.</p>
               <p>As Receiving implies and imports a getting into poſſeſſion what was out of poſſeſſion before.</p>
               <p>So it denotes paſſiveneſs rather then action: That is, A powerful virtue in him that gives, rather then any ſuch thing in the receiver. Such a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs Receiving hath in our ordinary ſpeech. As when we ſay an Army received the charge. We
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:159991:57"/>mean they ſtood out and bore the force and ſtrength of their adverſary, they did defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So in the Scripture, <hi>James,</hi> 1.7. <hi>Let not ſuch a man think he ſhall receive any thing from the Lord.</hi> In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Receiving the end of your Faith, the Salvation of your Souls.</hi> In <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7. The ground receiveth bleſſing from God. In all theſe places Receiving is of paſſive ſignification, noting ſomthing of action and excellency in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the giver but little of the ſubject at the firſt hand. In all the paſſiveneſs of underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there is ſome kind of action. For the Soul is not paſſive in the ſame manner, that a tree is unto the Ax that hews it: or as a ſtone is unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and hand that cuts and carves it. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to have ſuffered, yet even in that ſuffering, <hi>He laid down his Life</hi> (you know the Text ſpeaks) and he was obedient. A man is not converted unto God as a ſtock, or as a ſtone,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>John,</hi> 11 15.</note> but aſſoon as any Grace is given and infuſed into him, immediately at the very next apprehenſion, or upon his receiving the Grace, you muſt ſuppoſe the Soul acting, and moving, and ſtirring toward God. So it is in beleeving. Aſſoon as Faith is infuſed, ſo ſoon doth the Soul move toward God in Jeſus Chriſt. So that when I ſpeak of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs of the Soul, you are not to underſtand it as altogether without action. But the Soul is ſaid to be paſſive, becauſe it is firſt wrought upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can work any thing that is ſupernatural. The act of the Soul is not of it ſelf, but from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And there is more for degree of the vertue of him that works upon the Soul, then there is of any inward form and principle or habit in the Soul. But I uppoſe the diſtinction of active and paſſive obedience is not ſpecifical, but gradual. That is, that could not be called obedience wherein there
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:159991:58"/>was not ſome, though not ſo much willingneſs and ſubjectiveneſs, as there is bearing, Chriſt is ſaid to ſuffer, not becauſe he was not active, but becauſe that the hand of the Lord was heavy upon him. And at that time there was more diſpleaſure ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Father againſt Chriſt, then there was put forth of the vertues of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: For that was the vail both of the God-head, and of the Man-hood. Now according unto this ſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving is a receiving, and notes paſſiveneſs. The Soul doth go unto God through Chriſt, but that going is more from the power of God then it is from the habit of Faith. It is more from that ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then it is from that created quality, which we call Beleeving. We do beleeve, but we are made to beleeve. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. He that hath wrought us hereunto is God. Wrought us hereunto. Even as the Clay is wrought by the Hand of the Potter into this or that form, as is pleaſing to him. So in <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. The Apoſtle expreſſed his paſſiveneſs. <hi>If by any means I may attain unto the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> And appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that for which I am apprehended. But more eſpecially in <hi>Gala.</hi> 4.9. The Apoſtle doth correct himſelf for ſaying ſo much as this, That they knew God. After that they knew God, or rather were known of God. By knowing of God, he means beleeving. By his knowledg ſhal my righteous Servant juſtiffe many, ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. And yet we are juſtified by Faith. When the Apoſtle had ſaid, they knew God (as Faith indeed doth give a man an apprehenſion of him) becauſe this apprehenſion or knowledg of him is in the light of God (God makes known himſelf, and gives that whereby he is made known) he corrects himſelf therefore, and ſaith, I ſhould not have ſaid that I know God, but rather that I am known of God.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:159991:58"/>
                  <hi>John,</hi> 3.21. It is given in as the note and tryal of the Hypocritical work of the diſtinction between true Grace, and that which is not true Grace but counterfeit, that that which is true and good is wrought, and wrought in God. That is, it is wrought by God. As the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in, is uſed in the Scripture. So that is ſaid to be wrought in God, the power and vertue whereof comes from God. All actions conſiſt of their cauſe, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ends. Now as God is to be the object and the end ſo alſo to be the cauſe and the worker of all our actions. Wrought in God. You all know that Faith, it is a ſpiritual Life. In <hi>Gala.</hi> 2.20. I live by the Faith of the Son of God. You know that by Faith you convert and turn to God. For it is our anſwer in our calling. Now both our life and our motion to God, is from God: But moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.13. The Apoſtle ſpeaks to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Having</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſame Spirit of Faith, according as its written, I beleeved therefore have I ſpoken, we alſo beleeve, and therefore ſpeak.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. That whatſoever the Prophets ſpake, the ſpirit ſpake in them. It was not they that ſpake, but the Spirit of the Father that ſpake in them. So the Apoſtle gives the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he did deliver that Doctrin to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, becauſe ſaith he it was ſuggeſted unto me by Faith, and if you ask him how he came by that Faith, he ſaith he had it by the Spirit, It was not ſo much the Grace of Faith, as it was the ſpirit of Faith which made him both to beleeve and ſpeak. It is indeed, we that do beleeve. As the Prophets Mouth, and Lips, and underſtanding were all uſed by the Spirit of Prophecy, But as what they ſpake, was put into them: So what we do when we do beleeve is from the Spirit of Faith. <hi>Having the ſame Spirit of Faith, We beleeve</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:159991:59"/>
                  <hi>and therefore ſpeak.</hi> Beleeving is our act, but its by his vertue. And that I may open this more plainly to you, I ſhal inſiſt upon theſe three Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That that Faith whereby we do beleeve, is not of, or from our ſelves, but we receive it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That in that act whereunto we are inabled by God, we act as little as can be, but are acted. We are rather Receivers then doers.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That though we do beleeve never ſo little, yet the leaſt degree of Faith will give us Jeſus Chriſt, and all his priviledges. As many as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, had this dignity, (ſaith he) to be the Sons of God, though they did but receive him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Firſt of theſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. We cannot of our ſelves beleeve, or receive Chriſt. Therefore Faith is ſaid in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.8. To be the Gift of God. Not of our ſelves, but through Grace ye are ſaved through Faith, and not of your ſelves, it is the Gift of God. He laies no more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Faith but only this, that it was the means of our Salvation. God was the cheif and principal and efficient cauſe, ye are ſaved through Faith, but even That, you have not of your ſelves. In <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.12. Its called the Faith of the operation of God. Even as the Heavens are ſaid to be the work of his Hands, and the Firmament in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. That is, none could do and frame ſo glorious a thing beſides himſelf. We are not able to add one degree unto our Faith, when we have gotten it: and therefore we cannot obtain of our ſelves the leaſt degree before we have it. It is far more eaſie for a man to increaſe a ſtock, then to get it. In <hi>Lacke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke,</hi> 17 7. to the renth.</note> 17.5. The Diſciples come and Fray, <hi>Lord increaſe our Faith.</hi> Our Lord tels them by and by a Parable, that a Maſter doth not uſe to bid a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant when ho comes from the feild to ſit down, but
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:159991:59"/>to waite upon him til he hath ſupped, and he thinks not that the Servant hath any praiſe due unto him becauſe he waites for his meat, and waites at home, as well as abroad. And he makes this Concluſion of it, when you have done all you can, ſay you are unprofitable Servants. This being ſpoken upon their deſire of the Lords increaſing of their Faith, it holds forth thus much, that Let us uſe al the means that we can for the getting and the increaſing of our Graces, yet that is a work which we ſhal never do of our ſelves: We ſhal not move God to any thing, nor do any thing that ſhal be an addition to what God hath done. Now if we cannot add to the leaſt degree of Faith, then much leſs can we get the firſt degree of Faith. I ſay beloved we cannot receive Jeſus Chriſt: For there is no room in our Hearts naturally for him. All the faculties and places and capacities of our Souls being taken up with ſin and ſelf and with Satan. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. We are (na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally) ſaid to be filled with all unrighteouſneſs. We are born into the world as ful of ſin as we can hold. It is true we add to ſin, but it is becauſe our capacity to ſin is made greater by ſin, but as great as it is, it is filled. But we are ful of ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their is no room for Jeſus Chriſt. And if their were any room in our ſouls fit for Jeſus Chriſt (it being undefiled) yet we have no Heart unto Jeſus Chriſt. He came to his own,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John,</hi> 1.11. <hi>John,</hi> 5.40.</note> and his own received him not. Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life. Yea, We cannot naturally but refuſe to let Jeſus Chriſt reigne over us. For naturally ſin hath our affections, and is unto us as our ſelves: A ſecond nature: and nature labors to preſerve its ſelf, and therefore cannot but oppoſe Jeſus Chriſt, For his work is to take away ſin: Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the world.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:159991:60"/>
               <p>There are ſome material preparations unto faith (as they are called) whereby divers things that hinder Faith, are removed in ſome meaſure: And theſe are in the power of Nature. A man may be in his Natural condition, and have knowledg, and yet that knowledg doth remove away ignorance which is a great hindrance unto Faith.</p>
               <p>A man in his Natural ſtate may be troubled for his ſin, and yet that trouble for ſin doth take away pleaſure in ſin; and that pleaſure in ſin is a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance unto Faith.</p>
               <p>A man while he is in his Natural Condition may be in fear of the Judgments of God, and thereby have the boldneſs and confidence of his preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſpirit ſomwhat abated.</p>
               <p>Theſe preparations, theſe preparations I ſay are in our power. But for al theſe a man may never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve upon Jeſus Chriſt, he may for ever be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to him. Theſe preparations are not unto Faith, as degrees of heat are unto fire. There is not a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary connexion between theſe and beleeving: for a man may have them, and periſh, as you know, <hi>Judas</hi> had. Much leſs are they the laſt diſpoſition which immediately goes before Faith: and leaſt of all are they thoſe things which get any thing at the hand of God. But that which indeed doth prepare unto Faith properly, that comes from the Spirit of Faith alone: And ſo it's ſaid in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. That the Lord opened the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> to attend unto the things which were ſpoken by <hi>Paul.</hi> He opened her heart, that is, he opened her underſtanding to apprehend them; he opened the things themſelves that ſhe might look into them; he took away the prejudices that were in her thoughts againſt them: She had (by divers waies) her heart ſhut up againſt the Apoſtles Doctrine, even as a door in a Caſtle is barred that it muſt be broken open: but the Lord
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:159991:60"/>broke al thoſe bars. Such thoughts as theſe were in her ſelf: That if ſhe ſhould receive ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, ſhe ſhould make her ſelf to be by and by, the But of perſecution: All would forſake her, and ſhe muſt take up the Croſs: ſhe muſt leave that way of Worſhip which had been in uſe among her Fore-fathers; nay, ſhe muſt beleeve upon him to ſave her, that could not ſave himſelf. Whatever prejudices there were, the Lord took them from her; ſhe was not able to break one of theſe bars, nor to lay down one of theſe thoughts. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no other preparation required unto Faith, than what comes from the Spirit of Faith. As may appear by this:</p>
               <p>If there be any preparation required of us, we ſhal never know where to get or find it: For if we ſhal run unto this Grace, and that Grace, there muſt be a preparation unto that, for that is Grace; and unto that preparation there muſt be a preparation, for that is grace. And where will you find it? Go to thy Underſtanding, and there it is not; and unto thy Will and there it is not; and unto the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and there it is not: You will find that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be formed by any principle in us, but by the ſpirit of Faith. But as Faith is the gift of God,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8</note> ſo we can beleeve of our ſelves, and we cannot but through him beleeve. We reſiſt, but he overcomes our reſiſtance: We have no good will, but he works in us to will and to do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith that we are made to beleeve (in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18, 19.) as Jeſus Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead. It was impoſſible that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be held in the Chains of Death; and it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the Soul ſhould be held in the chains of Unbelief, when God comes to work Faith: that as the Apoſtle faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. laſt, <hi>No Prophecy came in the old time by the will of man; but holy men
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:159991:61"/>of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt:</hi> The ſame word which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that they cannot but ſpeak what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Lord; So neither can that heart but beleeve unto Salvation which God works upon.</p>
               <p>And this takes not from the freedom of man, nor from the liberty of his will: For this neceſſitates a good will unto him. And if it did not, truly it were better for us to want our wills, than for God to want his will: And it's better for us to be ſaved in a way which we underſtand not how it ſhould ſtand with our liberty, than to be left to our liberty to chooſe the way of our Salvation: But that is but by the way. Faith is a receiving, and we receive this power from the Lord himſelf to receive. We are paſſive in it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But Secondly, (which is a thing that I do a great deal more aim at) In that act of Faith wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are enabled by God, we act as little as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can be: there is as little done by us as may be, as little a touch (as I may ſay) as is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. The grace of Faith is uſually at the firſt but as a grain of Muſtard ſeed. But ſuppoſe it to be given at firſt Converſion in what degrees you pleaſe (unto ten degrees) yet that grace acts us, or takes as little hold on us as poſſibly may be The Spirit doth take faſt hold of us, and we by Faith take faſt hold of Chriſt; but though the hold be faſt, yet the hold is but little which Faith takes on us. Suppoſe a man that hangs ſure, but hangs but by one hand, and by one finger: or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a thing that is joyned and glued faſt unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it is joyned only by the edge, ſo that the faſtneſs ariſeth from the Sement, and glue, and the firmneſs of that, and not from the hold which the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:159991:61"/>other thing hath of it: Or (it may be this ruay ſet it forth more plainly to your underſtanding) as the hand of a Child in the hand of the Maſter, who teacheth him to write; The Childs hand doth as little as can be; though it makes every Letter, yet the Childs hand makes it by the skil, and direction, and power of the Maſter. So there is that of God which makes us to beleeve: God doth uſe the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and he doth uſe the Will in the Work of Faith, but as little as may be; though it be we that do beleeve, yet we do no more than ſubmit our ſelves to the work of the Lord. The Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will muſt be uſed, that ſo Faith may be our act; but he doth neither uſe the Will, nor the Underſtanding, but barely to give it a juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of our act. If Faith be not our act, then we are not quickned, nor ſaved by it, but it hath no more from us, than what may barely give it that denomination; we contribute no more than what may juſtly denominate the action to be ours. And this will appear (I conceive) if you do but conſider,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Oppoſition which is in us unto belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, even in the very inſtant when we do beleeve: I ſay, there is an oppoſition to us in beleeving, even in the very inſtant when we do beleeve: as much oppoſition made to Faith as poſſibly we can make, either by the malice in us, or by the aſſiſtance and temptation of Satan. <hi>No man can come to me</hi> (ſaith the Text, <hi>John</hi> 6.44, 45.) that is, Beleeve, <hi>except the Father draws him.</hi> Drawing imports with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, or drawing backwards from a thing: While God plucks, we pluck; and while he draws, we draw back. He draws by teaching us (for ſo the Text expounds it in <hi>John</hi> 6.) <hi>Ye ſhal al be taught of God.</hi> God convinceth us that there is no ſafety in that condition wherein we are; That there is no
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:159991:62"/>hope in any, but only in himſelf; that the longer we delay, the more unfit we be, the more our hearts will be hardned, the more his wrath will be provoked. While God is doing of theſe Acts and others, the Underſtanding, the Reaſoning is quite contrary; all the Reaſon in us, and all the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice that poſſibly can be, and all the objections that can be made, are made againſt Jeſus Chriſt, and againſt our going to him in our effectual Calling. God is putting in thoſe perſwaſions which may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with us, and the Underſtanding doth give forth croſs anſwers. There is no man comes, but God draws; and there is no man that God draws, but he doth withdraw, even while God draws. <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.31. <hi>Why did'ſt thou doubt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>O thou of little faith?</hi> The word that is tranſlated <hi>Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, doth properly ſignifie, the minds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in divers ſtations: the word ſignifies (I ſay) the mind to be in divers ſtations. As the Sea, when it is toſſed hither and thither: As the Mind when it is hurried up and down with divers unſetled appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and affections. As one thought comes and ſaith, Go to Chriſt; another comes and ſaith, As you love your life, do not go. At another time the ſoul reſolves it will go; By and by it reſolves it muſt not go, that is no way for it to take: It is but preſumption, and carnal confidence. A dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minded man (as unto principles) cannot be a Beleever. But in the act or exerciſe of a Grace, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of Faith, the Soul is of ſeveral minds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Lord comes to overcome, and mightily to ſubdue by the power of his Grace, all the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in our hearts againſt him. That is one thing therefore to prove that there is as little of us as can be in the act of Faith. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Nature of Faith it ſelf wil cleer it. Faith (as you have heard) hath its acts in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:159991:62"/>the Underſtanding, and its Acts in the Will: But now as it is in the Underſtanding, the Light of Faith is barely Gods Teſtimony: The things themſelves promiſed being left obſcure, and in the dark, as unto their own Nature: that is, a man doth beleeve the things of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and concernment to his Soul, only becauſe God ſaith they are thus and thus; and he know not, God being but a ſtranger to him: For as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally our Underſtanding pierceth and ſearcheth into the cauſes of things themſelves, and will not be contented to know with the light of another, but with the light of the things. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5. Faith goes another way; <hi>Truſt unto the Lord, and cleave not to thy own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. Every thought and imagination muſt be captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the obedience of Jeſus Chriſt, or the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith. It is not an aſſent from the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the things themſelves, but from the report of another. As a man beleeves there is ſuch a place as Paradice, or ſuch a City as <hi>Rome,</hi> though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw it, only becauſe of report. So that look upon Faith as it is in the Underſtanding, and it is a moſt irrational thing, and it hath as little of man in it as can be.</p>
               <p>Let me explain my ſelf thus:</p>
               <p>There are but Two Heads of all Knowledg.</p>
               <p>One is called an Artificial Argument, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the Natures of things themſelves.</p>
               <p>And another comes from the report of others. As one beleeves there is ſuch a place as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though he never did ſee it. Now for a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, becauſe another ſaith it, is to ſee with his eyes, and to beleeve upon his knowledg. And this is the way that Faith goes: It denies a man of his own Reaſon; and bids a man take al things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the report of the Lord, even in the things of his great Salvation.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:159991:63"/>
               <p n="2">2 Look upon Faith as it is an act of the Will, and what is it but a reſting? <hi>Let him ſtay himſelf upon his God, and upon the Lord,</hi> Eſa. 50.10, 11. And what doth it but only put out the ſparks of his own kindling? A man muſt be in the dark before he can do any of theſe acts. <hi>Who is it that fears the Lord, and obeys the voyce of his Servant, that is in darkneſs, and hath no light? let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and STAY himſelf upon his God. But he that kindles a fire, and compaſſeth himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with the ſparks of it, ſhall lie down in ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Will hath divers acts and motions, but faith ceaſeth all, and putteth an end to all the motions of the Soul, and all the courſes which the Soul did take for its good naturally; it ceaſeth from what it did naturally for its own good, and gives them a <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> and diſchargeth them from all their labor, and only leaves the Soul with God in Chriſt, and lets God do all. And hence it is beloved that there is ſo great a venture in Faith: Like the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that knew not what would become of them, only they knew that death would be, if they ſtayed in the City; and it might be, if they went down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Camp, they might have ſome relief: but they could find but death. Or as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he obeyed the Lord, not knowing whither he went: So doth a man in beleeving. Or as it is ſaid in <hi>Joel; Repent, for none knows but the Lord may return, and leave a bleſſing behind him.</hi> So, becauſe God commands, therefore the Soul goes upon theſe terms, though it knows no certainty.</p>
               <p>Yea, therefore hath Faith little of us, becauſe a Beleever knows not the time of his firſt converſion. He doth beleeve, and knows not that he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. Were there much of us in that act, it could not be but we ſhould know when we do it. As we know when we eat and drink, becauſe they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:159991:63"/>acts. But we beleeve, and know not that we do beleeve. Yea, often times becauſe we do ſo little, we are afraid we have no Faith: Becauſe we take Faith at the leaſt-wiſe to be ſuch an imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; action of ours, as ſhould make us to be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and forward, and ſingular in whatever we do. But that is a Second Demonſtration, That God doth by Faith take as little hold of us as may be, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our Underſtanding and Will as little as may be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: Let me add a Third, and that is that of the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26. <hi>Not many mighty, and not many wiſe, nor choſen.</hi> You would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wonder to ſee what poor and weak parted men Beleevers are. Faith requires no great parts: <hi>The things that are not,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith in the ſame Chapter, verſe 28.) thoſe are the things that God hath choſen. Somtimes I have ſeen a man of no great imployment in the World, and yet deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſighted into the things of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: As the laſt Demonſtration of it. You ſhal find that the Saints are ſenſible of a power working in them, and conſtraining them to go to Jeſus Chriſt. That even as a man that is under the power of Satan, though that reaſon be againſt his Luſts, yet ſtill he is put on, and egged to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of them. It's a ſign there is ſomwhat more than Natural corruption in him; becauſe according unto the Motion of Nature, theſe contrary reaſons would allay his deſire, and hinder his acts. There is a ſpirit of the Devil that blows up that luſt, &amp; puts on to that courſe again. And Beloved, Becauſe we find that when we would not beleeve, and ſit down reſolutely in our ſelves, and ſay we wil not beleeve, and it is not for us to look for any thing but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:159991:64"/>and that is all we ſhall have at Gods hand: yet notwithſtanding that, we find ſomthing within us bids us look towards the Lord, and to go unto him, and not to take our own words, and not to think it ſhall be with us as we think. Whence can this come, but from the Spirit of Faith? It is not from Grace only, but from that hand that acts it. That ſhall ſuffice for the Second thing: That Faith is not that which we have of our ſelves; ſo when God enables us to beleeve, he takes as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with that Grace of his as poſſibly may be.</p>

               <p n="3">III. LAſtly: Though we beleeve never ſo little, yet if we beleeve, we ſhall receive this Dignity to become the Sons of God. There is a receiving in the leaſt degree of Faith. That is that which the Text holds. This term <hi>[to Receive]</hi> notes as little action (as I ſaid in the beginning) as can be. Only it notes as being in ſubjection, a being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or a veſſel to put ſomthing into it. As Gold and Jewels may be wrapt up, and put into a filthy clout or rag: So may this Grace of Faith into an heart that is exceedingly corrupted and defiled. Again, you know you uſe to ſay, That the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of ſtoln goods, is not the principal offender; he is only one that doth con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eal and preſerve that which the other hath gotten. Such a kind of thing is Faith; he that doth receive is not the principal Agent. As the Wax doth receive the impreſſion of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:159991:64"/>the Seal, and yet the Wax doth no more than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Clay, or Earth, or any baſe Mettal (as Lead would do) only a compliance there is with the Seal.</p>
               <p>And let mead further. As Receiving notes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle action in that reſpect: So a narrow mouthed Bottle takes in but by little and little. As the ſtone upon which the Rain falls is hard, and but a little wrought upon and filled by it: things that are hard, are ſoftened by little and little. As the hard and ſtony Earth is ſoftened by the little Rain that falls long upon it. So now ſuppoſe a little Faith, and this gotten the hardlieſt, and come the ſloweſt by, that poſſibly can be; to be as weak as can be in your ſpirits, and to be as dull as is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: yet notwithſtanding this ſhall receive a bleſſing from God: even thoſe great bleſſings in the Text, not only to be a Son of God, but to have ſuch dealings from God as becomes a Child; and God deals in this like unto himſelf, according to the courſe which he took in charging us with the guilt of the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> For as we are conceived in ſin; that is, as ſoon as ever we are conceived, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, but curdled, and a ſpan long, we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, ſo ſoon is the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin imputed. So the very embrie, and the leaſt thing of Faith, is that which God will bleſs. The firſt conceptions of Faith are bleſſed, as the firſt conceptions of a man are accurſed becauſe of the Fall. So ſoon as ever we receive Chriſt, ſo ſoon is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt the Second <hi>Adam</hi> imputed and paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto us. <hi>He will not quench the ſmoaking Flax, nor break the bruiſed Reed,</hi> Matth. 12.20. There is great difference between flax and wood. Flax is but a blaze when it is light, and laſts not long. And ſo it notes ſuch a kind of Faith that is ſoon up, and ſoon down, exceeding tender and delicate, ſoon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:159991:65"/>diſcouraged and diſmayed. A Faith that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by fits only, and not ſuch a Faith as is of a conſtant motion. The ſmoaking of flax is leſs than the burning of it. The ſmoak may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſuch as either is offenlive unto the eye: And ſo there is a kind of beleeving, or I may rather call it, of unbeleeving, which is extreamly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive unto God, as ſmoak is unto the eye: When we are alwaies unſatisfied; when doubts beget doubts: when God anſwers one objection, and we take it up again: and we over and over again with things that have no reaſon in them, nor are fit to be ſpoken. But ſuppoſe it to be ſmoaking flax.</p>
               <p>Or, In regard of its weakneſs, which ſhall come into a flame afterwards, which is capable of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreaſe, as the ſmoak goes before the flame: yet the Lord will not quench it. What is that? he will cheriſh and nouriſh it: For the Negative includes the Affirmative. In <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>He that comes to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out;</hi> that is, I will entertain him.</p>
               <p>And as he will not quench the ſmoaking Flax, ſo he will not break the bruiſed Reed. Though Faith be as a Reed, a very weak thing of it ſelf; though it be bruiſed, and when it is bruiſed it will run into a mans hand, as you know the Scripture uſeth that ſimilitude concerning <hi>Pharoah.</hi> Many waies do we pierce the heart of the Lord, and grieve him with our Unbelief. We beleeve after ſuch a way, as it troubles him to ſee us. Though we be as a broken Reed that cannot ſupport, or be leaned upon. So though thy Faith be ſuch as is neither pleaſing to thy ſelf, nor unto God, and cannot carry thee through any Duty in Praying or Hearing, or other Ordinance; but as a man that leans upon a broken ſtaff, doth fall: So in every Duty, Thou prayeſt thy ſelf into anguiſh of ſpirit; and heareſt thy ſelf
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:159991:65"/>into troubles. Now although thou haſt ſuch a Faith as this, yet God will not forſake it, but che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it, and not break it, but bind it, and fit it for Spiritual uſe. Suppoſe a man doth by his doubts and cavils againſt God, offend him, as a Reed doth that runs into the hand; yet ſaith the Text, he will not break it that is, he will ſtrengthen it. For that is an uſual figure in the Scripture, when the Text ſaith, He will not do a thing, to mean that he will do the contrary unto it. As, thoſe that come unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out, but I will entertain, and ſup with them, and make them glad with my preſence. In <hi>James</hi> 2.26. the Apoſtle tels you, That that Faith that will ſave a man, is ſuch a Faith as hath a ſpirit with it: <hi>Even as the Body without the Spirit is dead, ſo is Faith without Works.</hi> That which I bring it for is this; That if there be but the leaſt Spirit or breathing in Faith, it is that which will ſave: I ſay, if there be but the leaſt breathing in Faith, it will ſave. As men that are exceeding tender and careful of the lives of thoſe that are ſick, when they ſeem to be as if they were gone and dead; they will lay a glaſs to their mouths, and if there be but the leaſt breath or ſmoak come upon the Glaſs, they will apply all manner of things that may recover them out of the ſwoun wherin they are. So is it with God. When thou thinkeſt thy ſelf to be gone, and thoſe about thee think thou art gone, and thou thinkeſt thou canſt never recover thy ſelf to any confidence of hope again, yet God wil hold a glaſs to thy mouth, and if there be but the leaſt breathing towards Jeſus Chriſt, it ſhall paſs with him as well as the noble Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> did when he could part with his Child at the Command of the Lord, which is the meaning of the Apoſtle in that place.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:159991:66"/>
               <p>Here is refreſhing and ſtrengthning unto that poor Soul that cannot go to Jeſus Chriſt, but crawl as I may ſo ſpeak: That liveth like a man in the Sea, and ſees the Banks, and ſaith, Oh that I were there, but knows not how to ſtrike a ſtroak to ſwim thither: or if he doth, his ſtroak is too weak to withſtand the Current, and the ſtrong ſtream of Temptation, and Doubts, and Fears that he meets withal. Thou thinkeſt thou ſhalt have nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou canſt do nothing: Thou canſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve firmly, thou canſt not lay on any hand but that which is trembling on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Thou canſt not look with any eye, but that which is weak and feeble. Now know, that God looks not for much from thee, but he intends much unto thee. He hath given thee this Grace of Faith, not becauſe it ſhould do great matters in thee, but for thee. It is only to take thee by the hand, and if it can bring thee and Jeſus Chriſt together, it hath done enough for thee, and as much as can be deſired, and as it is appointed unto. All the reſt of its acts are for thy comfort: but this is for thy Salvation.</p>

                     <hi>Faith conſidered in its loweſt degree.</hi> I. <hi>As in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding: and ſo it is,</hi> 1 <hi>Attention.</hi> 2 <hi>Inquiry.</hi> II. <hi>As in the Will: and ſo,</hi> 1 <hi>It is accompanied with much fear.</hi> 2 <hi>It is careful and ſollicitous for the things of this Life.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT will not be amiſs a little to conſider, or at leaſtwiſe to ſet down, how little Faith a man may have, or how little Faith God beſtows upon men, when yet he beſtows Chriſt upon men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take Faith as it is a Habit and Diſpoſition; ſo the loweſt degree of Faith is in an inclination, a yielding, a laying aſide the ſtoutneſs of the heart in ſome meaſure which he exerciſed before againſt God. In ſome meaſure. As the weather we ſay, begins to change when there is ſome melting of the Snow, and ſome yielding of the Ice, though it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard ſtill. And as we ſay, a man is inclined to peace, when he will treat and hear arguments for it, and doth not ſtand out in defiance. The leaſt Degree of an Habit is an inclination. And you ſhal find in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.8. That Faith is ſo deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to be no more a ſtiff-neckedneſs, but a yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves unto the Lord. As ſuppoſe a man that would not pay Taxes or Rates, but wil let another come and take it quietly: He will not give ſuch a thing, but if another will take it, he wil not oppoſe. In <hi>Acts</hi> 26. it is ſaid of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that her heart was opened to attend; that is, that whereas before ſhe looked upon what was ſaid by <hi>Paul,</hi> as not worth the hearing, and as that which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:159991:67"/>did not concern her, and which was not for her good and ſalvation, her heart was ſet and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt it; yet now ſhe begins to have other thoughts. It is as mean an act as poſſibly can be, for one to give God the hearing, to liſten to the things that are ſpoken, yet this the Scripture counts as a Work of God, and as the Fruit of her Faith. She attended to the things that were ſpoken. That is one low degree of Faith, for a man to be relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and yielding a little towards Jeſus Chriſt: To come, and mind, and obſerve the things that are ſaid of him, as things that are of concernment and moment.</p>
               <p>Again Secondly, It is a low degree of Faith to ask after, and enquire about the things which do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto Salvation. And this you ſhal find in the Scripture, that that enquiry, when it is truly and duly made is ſaving too. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Baptiſm ſaves: and the waſhing of the filth of the fleſh: But <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that word ſignifies not only an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but a Queſtion. The queſtioning of a good Conſcience, how by the Right of Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it might come unto Salvation? It's one of the ſmalleſt acts of the Underſtanding to enquire and ſearch after the knowledg of things. That ſame act of the Underſtanding exerciſed about the things of God by Jeſus Chriſt, that is, ſuch as ſhall be accompanied with Salvation. Baptiſme ſaves, the queſtioning of a good Conſcience. If indeed the Queſtion that men ask, comes out of curioſity and not out of Conſcience: If it comes only out of a Conſcience that is good thus far, Becauſe it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened; but not good thus far, that it is willing to ſubmit to, and take the courſe which the Goſpel enjoyns, then it is no ſign. But if the Soul doth but lie before the Lord, as the Reſurrection of Chriſt is appointed as the way of Salvation, ſo it
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:159991:67"/>ſaith, Lord how ſhal I take that way? which way may I come to be partaker of the power of it? This alſo ſhal be accepted.</p>
               <p>Look upon faith now as it is in the wil, or as it acts there (for I told you that faith acts both in the underſtanding and wil) you ſee how it acts the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in attention, and Inquiry. See how it acts the wil.</p>
               <p>It acts the wil moſt weakly when the heart is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with feare. Fear doth diſtract the Soul, and makes it to do al things dully and very imperfectly Why are yee afraid, therefore ſaith Chriſt (in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. and 14. Chapters) <hi>Oh ye of little faith.</hi> A man through feare doth in beleeving, as a man doth in going. He takes a ſtep, and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws his foot: He goes another, and then goes back again. So a man with one thought is for Chriſt, and in another thought, there is no hope for him in Chriſt: with one thought he gives up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him, and with another, it is but to give up a little ſtraw to the flame when thy heart is thus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (&amp; it's as diſpleaſing as can be poſſibly) yet this thought and this faith is not put out by the Lord; Though it be diſtracted yet that faith ſhal ſave.</p>
               <p>Again Secondly, That faith is exceeding weak, which is careful and ſolicitous for the things of this life. What an abſurd and weak thing is it for a man when he is dying to take care for cloathes? And when his life is going from him to think of purchaſing an inheritance? For a man when he is ful of dolor and pain, to think of increaſing his riches and eſtate? So is it a great weakneſs for a man to be careful for his body and the things of this life. In <hi>Math.</hi> 6.30. <hi>Chriſt ſaith when they ask what they ſhould eat and drink and put on,</hi> He calls them peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:159991:68"/>of little ſaith. Yet even that faith alſo the Lord wil acknowledg. I might go through divers other particulars. As for example. Our relying upon Chriſt which is the weakeſt and loweſt degree. That a man rather deſires to be ſaved by Chriſt than any other, but he finds a hankering after others; but I ſay he had rather have Jeſus Chriſt than any other: He is troubled when he hath hopes not by Chriſt beſtowed on him in the uſe of Ordinances. When you know a man relies upon another, the weakeſt confidence and reliance that he can put is this, To expect rather that he ſhould ſtand him in ſtead, than any other. This is that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith he will accept, and take from our hands. Go through all the ſeveral acts of Faith, take them at the loweſt, obſerve when as your hearts beat Chriſt-ward, but they beat floweſt, and feebleſt, and moſt uncertainly: yet know, that though there be much cauſe of humbling thee, and being aſhamed, that where a man may receive ſo much good, and where he hath ſo much reaſon to be good, yet then he ought not to caſt off his confidence, for ever this ſhall receive this Dignity to be the Son of God.</p>
               <p>And ſo much ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the Second Reaſon, why Beleeving is called Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Receiving denotes a meanneſs and lowneſs of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Receiver. And in this ſenſe Faith is a Receiving, whether you conſider it acting in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, or the Will.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>Thirdly: There is a meanneſs in Receiving. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving doth imply a meaneſs and lowneſs of condition, a want, or emptineſs, or being beholden to another. God therefore makes it his Glory, that he can challenge al the world to ſay, that they have given unto him any thing. Who hath given unto him, and inſtructed him? and it ſhall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced. It is an honor only belonging unto God, not to receive. In <hi>Acts</hi> 20.35. the Apoſtle doth adviſe them rather than they would hinder the Courſe of the Goſpel (who were Miniſters) to preach for nothing from the People; for ſaith he, <hi>Remember the words of our Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, It is more bleſſed to give, than to receive.</hi> There is at leaſt-wiſe a leſs bleſſedneſs in Receiving, than there is in giving; if I ſay not that there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs in it. Let that thing be never ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that a man hath, yet if he hath received it, he hath no cauſe to be proud or boaſt; the praiſe muſt not be given to him that receives, but to him that gives. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>If thou haſt received it, why doſt thou boaſt?</hi> Theſe ſeveral Inſtances proves that there is a meanneſs in receiving, that receiving ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a meanneſs of condition. A Condition, that a man is not able to ſubſiſt of himſelf without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in ſupplies from others without him. And
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:159991:69"/>thus Faith is called Receiving: becauſe where ever Faith is, who ever did, or doth, or ſhall receive Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, he doth receive him with the ſence of his own vile condition. There is not only ſuch an apprehenſion in him as this, that his ſtate is low, (That apprehenſion is true, and hath a real foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and there is no error in ſuch an imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore I am poor, and therefore I am una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do my ſelf good, or to do good, becauſe there is no way of Salvation to be had, but only by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, is a moſt certain and good way of Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: As he is a poor man that hath no way to live, but by taking the charitable Alms, and good will of others: So he is in a poor condition, and in a loſt condition that hath no means to ſave him, but what he can get by receiving.)</p>
               <p>Neither is a Beleevers condition vile only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſin and of puniſhment (wherof he is guilty before he doth beleeve) but this very act of Faith whereby a man doth receive, doth make a mans condition mean, though not miſerable. Through ſin and puniſhment, a mans condition is mean and miſerable: through beleeving a mans condition is not miſerable, but it is mean. It is a mean and low condition you know to live upon another; to go on truſt for every thing, to be beholden, and to beg Credit for whatever a man ſtands in need of. Conſider the ſtate of Faith with the certain Glory that comes by it (for therefore it is of Faith that the Promiſe may be ſure) conſider Faith as it is a relation,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.</note> and a receiving from ſo glorious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ones as God and Chriſt are: and ſo it is the moſt excellent condition in the World. A man lives better that way, than if he had all that in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency continued to him, wherein he was made. But now conſider this Receiving in and by its ſelf, and ſo it is a mean condition, becauſe it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:159991:69"/>one: he lives at the will of another. To eat ones own Bread (we uſe to ſay) is better a great deal, and far more honorable, than to live upon the Dainties of another mans Table. In the verſe before my Text, it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 1.11.</note> 
                  <hi>That Chriſt came to his own</hi> (that is, to the Jews) <hi>and they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not.</hi> Now therefore they did not receive him, becauſe of tht meaneſs of the life of Faith. He truſted in God (ſaid they) to deliver him;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.43.</note> Let him deliver him, if he will have him. As if they ſhould have ſaid: He is not a fit way for a man to truſt his Soul in; or he is not a fit perſon for a man to beleeve on for the ſaving of his Soul who cannot ſave himſelf. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. <hi>They went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and ſubmitted not to the righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> They ſubmitted not, that is, they thought the way of beleeving to obtain Salvation by, to be too poor and mean a condition. Now the Evangeliſt takes away this offence: <hi>To as many as received him, to them he gave this dignity to become the Sons of God.</hi> His meaning is, Though the life of Faith be mean in it ſelf, yet its glorious in its relation, for it makes you to be the Sons of God: Though the life be ſuch as is beneath, and lower than you could or would imagine ſhould make you happy, yet there is a greater freedom in it of converſe and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God than can be imagined: You ſhall live with God, as if you were in Glory already. That therefore which I would inſiſt upon in this, is this:</p>
               <p>Where ever true Faith is, there is a ſence of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The heart is humbled, and brought into the accompt of it ſelf as nothing. And as Faith grows, ſo doth this accompt of it ſelf grow alſo.</p>
               <p>Take Faith now as it acts on the Underſtanding, and there it makes a man to lay aſide what Reaſon
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:159991:70"/>ſaith. As <hi>Paul</hi> you know ſaith, He did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with fleſh and blood, but immediately follows the voyce he had received from Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not to thy own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. <hi>Every thought and imagination muſt be captivated</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>to the obedience of Faith.</hi> Take Faith as it acts in the Will.</p>
               <p>And ſo it takes away all Glory in a mans ſelf. <hi>How can ye beleeve, ſeeing ye receive Honor one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and ſeek the praiſe of men more than the praſe of God?</hi> Iohn 5.44. By what Law is boaſting taken away (ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.) but by the Law of Faith? And therefore you ſhall find that when ever any of the Saints of Jeſus Chriſt have through Faith attained unto any thing, they correct themſelves, and uſe al kind of diminutive and leſſening expreſſions that may be concerning themſelves. <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>yet not I:</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. I live, but not I. <hi>I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, The root of my life lies in his love. He loved me, and revealed that to me, and my Faith laid hold of it, and that quickned me. As Faith cannot aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any Error; no man can with a Divine Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve any thing that is falſe, becauſe the object of Divine Faith takes the infallible Teſtimony and Truth of God. So Faith, as it is in the Will, makes a man that he cannot but be humbled, he cannot be lifted up; Why? Becauſe it leads a man out of himſelf unto another for all he hath. As infallible Truths and Errors are contra-diſtinct, and cannot conſiſt together; ſo is going out of a mans ſelf to receive, and being lifted up. Faith may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Golden Hammer: as it is Gold, it is excellent; but as it is a Hammer, it ſubdues and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:159991:70"/>beats down, and keeps down every thought and imagination. As there is ſome Phyſick that doth at the ſame working both purge and ſtrengthen. Such a thing is Faith, it empties a man of himſelf, and fills him with Chriſt: it takes a man off his own bottom, and ſets him on Chriſt: it deſtroyes in him the confidence he had, and gives him a ſpirit above al his danger, or to conteſt with all his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger through Jeſus Chriſt: it makes him to do all things, and yet makes him ſee that he is able to do nothing: <hi>Lord encreaſe our Faith,</hi> ſaid the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unto Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.5. As if they ſhould have ſaid, We are not able to add one degree; we are not able to improve the Faith we have, one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, not the leaſt circumſtance. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>I have labored more than them all, yet not I, yet not I.</hi> True Faith makes a man as earneſt for every thing as if it were his own, and due by merit; and it makes a man as humble when he hath any thing, as if he had nothing at all, but aſcribes all unto Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God the Father in him. There is not a motion of Faith; mark it, but if ſo be that you did attend unto it, and underſtand it, you would find it to be of this ſenſe. As God ſaid unto the People of Iſrael, That he had delivered them, <hi>but not for your ſakes do I do this, but for my own Names ſake.</hi> So ſaith Faith, All this that is done for you, it is not for any thing that you have done, but for the ſake of him who hath fulfilled all Righteouſneſs. <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10. cried unto the People, <hi>Be it known unto you that by the Power of Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>and by the Name of him whom you have crucified, this man doth ſtand among you.</hi> So when Faith hath received all from Chriſt. it ſaith unto the Soul, Be it known unto you, that you may thank the Lord for this; it is not your good deſires, or performances, or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:159991:71"/>good diſpoſition, and this leaves the Soul exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humble; As you have ſomtimes writ upon ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is done for publick uſe, This is the gift of ſuch a one and ſuch a one. And as poor men do weare the armes of thoſe that give them cloaths and food in the Almes-houſes: ſo faith doth put forth ſuch a work in the ſoul, that it leaves behind it this ſence, That it is done for us of Gods free grace and not for any thing in us. Doſt thou find there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thy affections grow leſſer and leſſer to thy ſelf? Thou art leſs and leſs conſiderable in thy own eyes every day; When thou lookeſt upon what thou haſt received thou wondereſt wherefore God ſhould do it, That upon ſuch a one as thou art his hand ſhould be ſtretched forth, and unto ſuch a one as thou art he ſhould give ſo much? Art thou when thou getteſt any refreſhing from Chriſt, art more aſhamed of thy ſelf? doſt thou magnify Chriſt more, and vilify thy ſelf more, Thou mayſt then think it to be true becauſe faith is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
               <p>So that the Sum of the point is this: The life of faith is meane, not in regard of the things recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by faith: (For we receive him ſaith the text, that is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and ſuch things with him which eye hath not ſeen, nor eare heard, nor hath entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.) nor is the life of faith meane in regard of him from whom we receive, for in that reſpect it is a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the wel head, it is the ſervice of a King. I <hi>know ſaith</hi> Paul <hi>whom I have truſted,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12 One that is able. Nor thirdly is the life of faith in its ſelf, ſimply conſidered meane. For the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of a creature doth lie in its dependance upon God, even as the being of the ſtreame lyes in the flowing of the water from the fountain.</p>

Guilt: for where there is no offence, there needs no pardon nor forgiveneſs. And it ſuppoſeth weakneſs, as not being able to keep our ſelves in the love of God by any thing that we are able to do.</p>
               <p>There are two things which do mainly make the life of faith to be meane.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe its a life of dependance. A man lives not of himſelf, nor on his own, but he lives upon another. He eates not his own bread (as I may ſo ſpeak) nor wears his own cloaths, but what is given him. And not only ſo, but.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the ſecond place. A man receives not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by faith, but from hand to mouth. Suppoſe al a man had was given him, but he did receive it at once, and ſo became maſter of it himſelf for his uſe and diſpoſe of it, then there were ſome honour in it you know. The Prodigal you know prays that he may live no longer at his fathers hand, but that he may have his portion, and live like a man of honor upon his own. But through faith we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no more then we have need of, and we have no more then we need. We are fain to go to God for every penny and morſel. The life of faith is often ſeen in prayer. It is al one, as I often ſhewed you in the ſcripture for a man to beleeve upon God and for a man to pray to God, and for a man to live upon begging, and to have no more then every day he can get as an alms, or as a favor. That is ſuch a kind of life as takes away al glory, and al confidence in a mans ſelf.</p>
               <p>Object, But you wil ſay unto me, <hi>That this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſcourage a man from any way looking after that life of faith, becauſe it is ſo meane,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:159991:72"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer to that in a word. That there is no reaſon it ſhould diſcourage. For it is better for us a great deal conſidering what we are to have in this way, then any other. For</p>
               <p>Firſt, God wil look better to us, then we can look to our ſelves. As a bird in the Cage is more tendered, and better provided for then ſhe could be if ſhe had her liberty in the wild waſte flying up and down in the vaſt wilderneſs. We live upon God, but we live upon one that is bountiful, and liberal, and one that hath enough, and one that thinks nothing too much to give to us. Were our eſtate in our own hands, we would quickly ſpend it or ingage and morgage it, and bring our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrath, which now the Lord prevents. Such a kind of living upon God by faith is exceeding Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious unto God. For upon this account he hath Glory, that he doth provide for us al things that do belong unto life and Godlineſs. Yea.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a great deal of ſweetneſs in this life. As a bit (you know) from a Princes hand at his table, hath more ſweetneſs in it then a whole diſh. What ever proviſion we could make for our ſelves, could not carry that refreſhing to the heart, which the leaſt thing doth which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God by Chriſt through faith. For it carrys this with it, The love of God in Chriſt, the favor and loving kindneſs of God: his wiſdom, which cuts out this portion for me, who knows what is better for us then we can choſe for our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Laſtly to ſay no more. Though the life of faith be meane in it ſelf, yet this ſhould encourage to it, becauſe it is ſo meane, therefore pride is hid from your eyes. There is nothing that hinders a man more from receiving from God, then pride doth. Jam. 4.6. <hi>He gives grace to the humble, but he reſiſts
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:159991:73"/>the proud.</hi> There is nothing more burdenſom to a Beleever than pride of heart is. Pride of heart is unto the Soul of a Beleever, like the ſwelling of a Joynt which puts to extream pain. Saith the Soul in it ſelf, I have nothing, and can do nothing, and am nothing, and yet notwithſtanding I am lifted up as if I wanted in no kind. As you know it is ſaid concerning the Church of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> To be poor, and yet proud: To borrow, and yet to carry it as if we were beholden to none, is as great wickedneſs as poſſibly can be before the Lord. Becauſe all this is hindred by Faith, therefore it is a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Life of Faith, though it be a mean Life in compariſon.</p>

                  <p>Application. <hi>The Reaſon why Beleevers are tempted to Pride.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ALL that I ſhall ſay by way of Uſe (and ſo paſs on unto the next) is this:</p>
               <p>Firſt, You may from hence ſee the Reaſon why Beleevers are ſo much tempted unto Pride: unto Pride in thinking of themſelves otherwiſe than is meet, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks: unto Pride in negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:159991:73"/>good works, as neceſſary unto the attaining and perfecting of Eternal Life. As ſome that are well born and deſcended, cannot endure to fal unto mean imployment. So doth the Devil labor to put it into the hearts of Beleevers, that they need not be ſo careful in Duty, nor ſo ſtrict and exact in the performance of the Law, for they are the Sons of God, and born unto Eternal Life as their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. Now the Reaſon why the Devil doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to ſtir the Saints to this, is, Becauſe that Pride is the moſt contrary unto the Life of Faith, and the condition we are put into through beleeving. For to ſee (as I ſaid now) a Beggar Proud, or a Servant Reign; to ſee an Alms man (who is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed of meer Mercy) to jet and ſtrut as if he were cloathed in Gold of his own, is the moſt uncomly ſight in the World. And ſo uncomly do we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves in the ſight of God, when (becauſe of the ſtate we are in) we grow proud. For what have you to be proud of? For there is nothing that you have, but what you have received.</p>
               <p>And again. Hence it doth appear that where ever there is true Faith, there wil be humbleneſs of Spirit, For the Spirit is ſuited to the condition and life which Faith brings in from Chriſt, but it emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the Soul of it ſelf, according as it doth bring in. So much a meaner opinion a man grows into of himſelf, as he grows more into the enjoyment of Chriſt. There is this temper of heart in a Beleever, that as he rejoyceth in this, that he hath much in Gods hands to receive, ſo alſo he doth walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>He works out his Salvation with fear and trembling:</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe it is God that worketh in him both to will and to do.</hi> And if a man would make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf whether he be in the Faith or not, if he would diſcern whether he hath received Jeſus
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:159991:74"/>Chriſt unto the Salvation of his Soul or not, he may know it by this as ſoon as by any thing; Doth thy Spirit grow more humble? Art thou more vile in thy own eyes? Seeſt thou leſs worth, nay, no worth in thy ſelf? Doth the manifeſtation or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Grace from Chriſt, make thee to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor and loath thy ſelf? But I ſhall ſpeak a little more to this particular by ſhewing you,</p>
               <p>That where ever indeed there is true Faith, there is humbleneſs of Spirit manifeſted in theſe four Particulars. There are four Particulars I ſay, wherein humbleneſs of Spirit doth alwaies ſhew it ſelf in a Beleever.</p>
               <p>Firſt. In modeſty, or ſobriety. Not aſſuming unto its ſelf the doing of any thing, or being the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto God, or the Reaſon why God ſhould do any thing to him. <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name be the praiſe,</hi> is the voyce of Faith, according to that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.1. <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt that liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2 20. <hi>I have done more than they all, yet not I, but the Grace of God in me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. And as the Pſalmiſt ſaith in another caſe, <hi>We got not the Victory by our own ſtrength and ſword, but it was thy hand and power that gave us the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Pſal.</hi> 44.3. So the Soul ſaith, That it is not its praying or hearing, or any thing whereby it doth attain unto any favor with God, or any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Grace, but only becauſe the Lord ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. As there can be no reaſon given why the Rain ſhould fall upon one ground, and not upon another, but only becauſe the Lord Reigns and Rules in Heaven. So there can be no reaſon given (ſaith the Soul) why I that am a barren deſert, ſhould have any life rained on me, but only becauſe it ſeems good unto him. That is the firſt thing.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:159991:74"/>
               <p>Secondly, The humbleneſs of Faith ſhews it ſelf in a ſenſe and apprehenſion of that condition which a man was in, before he did receive Grace. As a man unto whom a proſperous eſtate is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he remembers his poor eſtate and low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So doth a man now (that hath received by Faith from Chriſt) remember what ſtate he was in when Chriſt firſt came and gave him ſomwhat, and beſtowed himſelf upon him. Here the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of it, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>I was a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, and injurious, and a Perſecutor, and the chief of all ſinners.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>We were by Nature</hi> (that is, we that are now quickned, and who are now raiſed up together with Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath as well as others, and under the Prince of the Air,</hi> even the Devil, who Ruleth in the hearts of ſuch Children of diſobedience as we were. And therefore upon all occaſions you know he is up with his converſion, telling what an ill courſe he was in; and what wickedneſs he was practiſing when the Lord lighted on him, as you may ſee in divers places in the <hi>Acts.</hi> It is true indeed, that there is a paſſionate ſenſe of a mans miſery, which doth ceaſe when a man hath received mercy; that is, a man cannot ſo mourn, nor a man cannot ſo weep and lament as he did do; yet there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſenſe. A ſenſe that lies upon the heart as ſure, though it works not after the ſame way; and as cleer, though it hath not the ſelf ſame paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were before. Though the wound be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, yet there is a ſcar that puts in mind. And though the Lord hath been pleaſed to take away the danger, yet the Soul cannot but ſtand and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at that condition wherein it was when the Lord delivered it. That is the Second.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The humbleneſs which Faith works in the heart of a man, is this; The acknowledgment
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:159991:75"/>and owning of al that is in a man unto God. As we are wont to write in the Books that are given us, <hi>The Gift of ſuch a Friend, or ſuch a Friend.</hi> Or as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, he came over that Brook with a ſtaff in his hand, and now he had ſo many bands, But the Lord hath given them to him. Behold I and the Children which the Lord hath given me, Or as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid at another time when his father asked him how he came by Veniſon ſo ſoon, ſaid he, The Lord brought it to hand. So the Soul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth whatever he hath received to be of meer Grace. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>He that hath wrought us hereunto is God, who hath alſo given unto us the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Mark the word: We are wrought hereunto. That is, as if he ſhould have ſaid, if there had not been more done by another than was by our ſelves, if we had been left to do for our ſelves, we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to this ſtate of Grace wherein we are: We were but like Clay, and He faſhioned us into this Mould. He, Who is that? Even God. He that hath wrought us hereunto is God: that is, Infinite Power, and Wiſdom was imployed in thoſe things, and no leſs would have done the thing. And ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. It is given to us, to know the things that are freely given us of God. Ask a Beleever how it came to paſs when he and others ſate under the ſame miniſtry, and in the ſame ſeat, and it may be had the ſame convictions, that one turned his back upon God, and the other came in; that one held up weapons of rebellion againſt God, and the other laid them down. Or thus; That the one is more wrought upon, and the other is leſs; that the one hath perfect Peace, and the other ſtand diſputing, being filled with fears, and jealouſies, and ſuſpitions. The Soul will anſwer that it was not for any thing that I did more than any other, it was not becauſe I was better than another, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:159991:75"/>the Lord put forth his Power upon me, and hath more effectually called and wrought in me, than he hath been pleaſed to do upon others. That is the Third Thing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Humbleneſs which Faith works in the Soul, is this, that it makes a man to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly wary and faithful in the uſe of all that which he hath received by beleeving. If he hath gotten peace, he keeps it warily and charily. If he hath gotten Grace, he maintains it watchfully: and he is faithful, not becauſe he doth not look upon himſelf as a Lord over it, but he looks upon it as a Gift meerly given him. If a man (you know) hath any gift given him by a Friend, though it be very uſeful, yet he is very chary of the uſe of it, and will not uſe it but upon great occaſions. There is you know, a great deal of difference between a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his life by Grace, and pardon from the Prince; and a mans receiving his life upon tearms of Juſtice: He that hath his life upon Pardon, is afraid if he ever comes again within the breach of the Law any more: Whereas he that hath his life upon Juſtice, thinks not of any ſuch danger, nor of any ſuch evil that he needs to beware of. So much carefulneſs, ſo much Wiſdom and Warineſs as there is in the Soul to uſe what it hath received, ſo much doth it argue Faith in a man.</p>

                     <hi>Receiving denotes taking a thing with joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart; and ſo Faith is receiving. An Object. anſwered.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>Faith is called receiving, becauſe the ſoul that doth beleeve, doth beleeve willingly and cheerefully. Receiving in the ſcripture is uſed for ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as freinds give one unto another. Or gueſts or ſtrangers have of their freinds, As in <hi>Math.</hi> 10.14. And <hi>Luke,</hi> 20.10. Chriſt ſends his diſciples abroad without any thing to live upon, and faith <hi>If they wil receive them,</hi> that is, if they wil be glad of the Goſpel at ſuch a charge, and at the coſt they muſt be at. In Heb. 13.2. <hi>Be not forgetful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſtrangers, for in ſo doing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſome have received Angels.</hi> As it is in that place of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.41. <hi>He that receives a Prophet in the name of a Prophet,</hi> that is, that makes him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as the Meſſenger of God. In the third Epiſt. of <hi>John</hi> and verſ. 9. Diotrephes <hi>that loves the preheminency received us not nor would have ſuffered the Saints to receive us.</hi> As the Text tells us in the Book of Geneſis, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtood at the door of the Tent that he might entertain ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that paſſed by. And <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw Chriſt in Heaven, and therefore uſed the word of the Text, <hi>Lord Jeſus Receive my ſpirit. Acts,</hi> 7.59. My meaning is this, Though I cannot look upon Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as my own houſe and home; Though I be a ſtranger and cannot demand the glory thereof as due unto me, yet receive me kindly, Bid me be of good cheer, and give me what is laid up in ſtore
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:159991:76"/>there. Al this I have ſpoken to ſhew that this word (Receiving) is proper to a kindly entertainment. Now faith is ſuch a kind of receiving and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jeſus Chriſt in ſome meaſure. I ſay in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. As Jeſus Chriſt doth receive the ſoul into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo doth the ſoul receive Jeſus Chriſt into it by beleeving. That ſelf ſame love which Chriſt ſhews, that kindneſs which he expreſſeth to the ſoul in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining it into Glory that in ſome meaſure doth the ſoul expreſs in its laying hold upon Jeſus chriſt. It is ſaid in <hi>Luke,</hi> 19.5. 6. That Chriſt bad himſelf to <hi>Zacheus</hi> his houſe to dinner: Zacheus <hi>come down, and make haſt, for this day</hi> I <hi>muſt abide at thy houſe: And</hi> Zacheus <hi>came down &amp; made haſt &amp; received him joyfully.</hi> Thus is it in effectual calling, in converſion. Chriſt comes unto a ſoul and ſaith, <hi>Turne unto me &amp; live: Beleeve &amp; you ſhal be ſaved, why wil you dye in the way wherein you are?</hi> Though there be nothing belong unto you but ſhame and confuſion of face for ever, yet by, and in me you ſhal find happineſs. As Chriſt doth firſt offer unto the ſoul himſelf, So doth the ſoul receive this offer of Jeſus Chriſt. In <hi>Acts,</hi> 8.37. Though that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was but a young convert yet notwithſtanding of him, as of a young convert, <hi>Philip</hi> requires he ſhould beleeve with al his heart. <hi>If thou beleeveſt with al thy heart.</hi> Al the heart, is not there taken extenſively or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, that is al one with perfection. As it is in the Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with al thy heart,</hi> that is love him, and love nothing elſe. But al the heart there, is oppoſed unto a divided heart, and unto an unwilling ſpirit. If thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt with al thy heart, that is, if thou be glad of Jeſus Chriſt to undertake for thee: If thou doſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly give up thy ſelf unto him for ſalvation. I ſay there is a great deal of difference between a mans doing of a thing willingly, and doing a thing elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ively and out of choice.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:159991:77"/>
               <p>A thing is ſaid to be done willingly, when it is done out of a principle ſuitable to it, though that in the doing of it there be no thought of taking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment or pleaſure in it. As a man ſins willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the corruption that is in his heart doth break into act. As for example,</p>
               <p>A man that hath a prophane and wicked ſpirit, he ſweares willingly, though he doth not think of ſwearing when he doth it. So al actual corruptions are voluntary, though that we do not conſider what we do. As the wiſe man ſpeaks, that they know not that they do evil, becauſe it comes from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt heart within. To do a thing voluntarily and willingly, it is enough that a man doth it of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, moved thereunto of his own diſpoſition and quality of mind.</p>
               <p>A thing is ſaid to be done electively or by choice when a man (having weighed arguments on both ſides) doth chooſe one rather then another: He puts a difference between the reaſons that are ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on either part, and chooſeth to follow one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.26. Moſes <hi>is ſaid to chooſe afflictions with the people of God, becauſe he judged or eſteemed,</hi> ſaith the Text. Doing things out of choice is a manner of doing things willingly, and the higheſt ſort of ſo doing. And So there is a difference between a mans beleeving willingly and cheerefully, and a mans beleeving electively, and out of choice. A man beleeves willingly when he is carried unto Jeſus Chriſt by the ſpirit of faith in a ſenſe of his own nothingneſs, and a knowledg of the tenderneſs and ſufficiency that is in Jeſus Chriſt to ſave him. A man beleeves out of choice, when he chooſeth rather to adventure his ſoul in that way of beleeving upon Chriſt, then in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe. As for example. Conceive you a man like him that came to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt willing to do any thing to obtain eternall life:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:159991:77"/>And as a meanes thereunto, there is advice given him to repent of what he hath done, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his luſts, that he ſhould take up the practiſe of al dutyes and ordinances, heare much, and pray often, and deny himſelf opportunities of ſin, and give that which he hath unto the poor; And al this advice is urged upon him with al that can be ſaid from the ſcripture and reaſon, that if he doth thus he ſhal be ſaved: But he is alſo adviſed to beleeve upon Jeſus Chriſt who Juſtifies the ungodly, who cures a man for nothing, who ſaves them that are not able to returne him any thing again ſuitable to what they receive from him, And he chooſeth this way of faith rather then that other way. This now is a beleeving out of choice: when. I ſay al other wayes are laid before a man for ſalvation in their greateſt probability, and yet a man can ſee faith to be the beſt way, and can anſwer the reaſons that are brought to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Unto this election faith wil grow in time and by experience. So that it can ſay, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and I have none on earth in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of thee. Pſal.</hi> 73.25. Therefore it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Marriage, which cannot be without union to Chriſt, and willingneſs to be ſo. A woman after Marriage comes to ſay if ſhe were unmarried again, ſhe would have none but him, for when the ſoul hath had ſome experiences of God, if ſo be that al the delights and pleaſures that are in ſin, nay that are in holineſs, were ſet before it, it would chooſe rather to live upon Jeſus Chriſt then that way, As the good man ſaid when he ſaw <hi>David</hi> come home let him take al, now the Lord my King is ſafe. So the ſoul can ſay, I have enough in him, though I have nothing elſe, and let al other things be what they wil, yet through him I ſhal ſtand.</p>
               <p>But at the firſt, the Act of faith is only willing, I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:159991:78"/>ſuppoſe. And therefore you ſhal find beleevers to be alwayes deſcribed that way. <hi>John,</hi> 8.56. Abraham <hi>ſaw my day afarre of.</hi> He ſaw it by faith. That is the ſpiritual optick, which makes things farre of, to be neere. <hi>He ſaw my day afarre off and was glad.</hi> As a man that ſees the ſhoare many Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues off at Sea, where the ſhoare looks like a cloud One would have thought it would have made the heart of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſad, that the day of Chriſt was ſo farr off. For hope that is deferred, is the breaking of the heart ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> What joy (do you think) would the day of Chriſt have been, had it come upon <hi>Abraham,</hi> who when he ſaw the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it ſo many thouſand yeares off, was filled with Joy. But where ever there is a ſight of Chriſt there is joy and gladneſs. That I bring it for. Though it be at never ſo great a diſtance, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo weak a ſight. When the power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth prevaile, it makes his people wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. As it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, that with the mouth a man doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>but with the heart a man doth beleeve unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Rom.</hi> 10.10. With the heart. As we uſe to ſay, I am glad of it with al my heart. Or you have my heart. So now doth the ſoul ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus Chriſt in beleeving. He is taken with the object of faith, and is rejoyced. So it is in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>We are the Circumciſion, who rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</hi> Mark it. The Miniſters by whom the Goſpel is brought unto men are beautiful unto beleevers. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings.</hi> His meaning is, As beauty wins &amp; takes affections, ſo are our affections carried ſtrongly unto thoſe who are the meſſengers of good things by Jeſus Chriſt. If you have judged me faithful (ſaid <hi>Lydia</hi>) then come into my houſe. And if you be worthy (ſaid our Lord
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:159991:78"/>though you have no cloaths on your back, nor pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in your purſe, yet you wil be welcome to them. And the word of Faith which is the inſtrument of Faith, that is now received alſo by a Beleever. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44, 45, 46. The kingdom of God is like a man that found a Treaſure in the field, and he went and ſold all that he might be partaker of it. Every act of Faith, it is done with joy and delight. Therefore Faith (in the generall) is ſaid to work by love, and to be unfeigned, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 1.5. <hi>Out of a good Conſcience, and Faith unfeigned.</hi> Why, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is hearty, there is an affection, and an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is real where there is true Faith. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>You received the word of God in much afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with joy of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And therefore you are elected of God.</p>
               <p>It is therefore by cheerfulneſs and readineſs in believing, that true Faith is diſtinguiſhed in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>As many as gladly received the word were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi> They gladly received, is a note of diſtinction from the reſt of the Auditory who received it, but not with joy and gladneſs: By it I ſay true Faith is diſtinguiſhed and diſtinguiſhed from the Faith that is in the Devils, and in wicked men, who are the Children of him, and from that which doth ariſe from conviction. A man may beleeve through conviction, as the Devils do: who finding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be true which God hath ſpoken, their own experience being a witneſs to them that God hath not failed of his word, they do therfore col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that what he hath ſaid beſides, ſhal be brought to paſs: But that which they do beleeve, they would not beleeve. There is the like Faith in the Children of Satan. For as there is the ſame Grace in the head, Chriſt, and in his members, ſo there is the ſame ſinfulneſs and evill that is in Satan (the head and Prince of wicked men) in wicked men
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:159991:79"/>themſelves. While wicked men live under the preaching of the word of God, they come to be convinced that there is no way of ſalvation but by Chriſt, nor any courſe to get eternall life, but by going unto him: But this they like not, but ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſh that there were ſome other way, which is evident and apparent, becauſe their hearts do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw through unbeliefe, and depart from the living God, As the Apoſtle ſpeaks in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12.</p>
               <p>There is a going unto Chriſt by men, as a man goes unto an enemy, and ſues for ſome favor that is in his hand to do him, which he can receive no where elſe; but yet it troubles him. So now they go unto Chriſt, but they had rather be in hard and coſtly working. If faſting and prayer, and giving all their goods to the poor would help them, they would rather do it than go to Jeſus Chriſt. As wicked men do pray in afflictions, but it is becauſe they are driven to it: ſo do they beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they know no way elſe to go, or to find relief unto themſelves. He that is a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth chooſe Jeſus Chriſt as his way: He doth chooſe him (I ſay) as his way or rather thus, he doth like that way and approve that way.</p>

So far they did receive the Goſpell as it might free them from Hel,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:159991:79"/>but not as it might ſanctifie or take away from them the love of this preſent World: for when perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came, they were by and by offended.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>BUt now I ſhall come to ſpeak of Faith in this point more particularly, As it is a willing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Jeſus Chriſt: a Receiving of him kindly and gratefully. And that I may ſpeak of it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly to you.</p>
               <p>There is (you muſt know) a love that is ever joyned with Faith. Faith works by love: And that love is ſet upon Jeſus Chriſt ſingly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for his ſake. The heart doth approve and like of its ſelf in believing on or going to Jeſus Chriſt: That if a Believer could immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon what he hath done, when he hath cloſed with Jeſus Chriſt, if he had (I ſay) a reciprocall knowledg of his action, that he could ſay I have now given up my ſelf to him, and this giving up my ſelf to him is forever, never to be my own any more: If he could thus reflect upon himſelf, he would bleſs the Lord for helping him ſo to do. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this.</p>
               <p>There is a love which goes along with Faith: A love unto Jeſus Chriſt alone, beſides the approbation of the Soul in believing: As the Eye delights in ſeeing, and the Ear is taken with ſound: So there is a contentment and pleaſure that the Soul takes in Faith. (As it is in <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.15.) ſaid concerning
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:159991:80"/>righteouſneſs in the generall, That it is a joy to a juſt man to do juſtice: So it is a joy to a good man to beleeve: which I ſhall lay open in divers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take Faith firſt (as we handled it hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to be an Act of the Underſtanding, an aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto the truth which God ſpeaks, though the things be not only obſcure, but contrary to Reaſon, it is a pleaſure now unto a Beleever to do ſo. To give up his judgment to God: To have his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg from the report which God gives of things, and not from himſelf, or his own apprehenſion. Therefore you ſhall find him to pray God to lead him by his counſell, till he brought him to Glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24. And <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. when he was called, he would not conſult with fleſh and blood to hear what they could ſay, but becauſe of the divine teſtimony which he had received, he gives up himſelf unto Jeſus Chriſt, and unto the work of the Miniſtry. Hence it comes to paſs, that though you may ſilence a Saint, yet you cannot convince him that he is in an error. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. <hi>The ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall man judgeth all things: But he himſelf is judged of none.</hi> As <hi>Bathſheba</hi> took all the waies ſhe could to make her Son <hi>Solomon</hi> to raign, in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.17. <hi>Didſt thou not ſay that my Son ſhould raign, And why is it not ſo?</hi> She ſtuck unto his word, and took no other way. So doth Faith take that way: Thou haſt ſaid, Thou haſt ſaid, Thou haſt ſaid. And as a proof of that, that Faith delights to take Gods word by way of evidence, rather than any other, In <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. it's ſaid, <hi>By Faith we underſtand that the world was made of nothing.</hi> We know it by reaſon, that the world was made of nothing: But that doth not content a Beleever, But by Faith we know it: Becauſe we rather judg by the light that comes from God, than by the light that is in the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:159991:80"/>things themſelves. I beſeech you my beloved mark it. In humane affairs and in things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto men, It is as great a weakneſs as can be to depend upon others, to ſee with other mens eyes, and not with a mans own, To ſay as other men ſay, and to ſpeak after them. We count it no learning at all (neither is it) for a man to quote Authors, and to ſay ſuch a man is of this mind, and ſuch a man is of that mind. A man may be as ignorant as the Books themſelves are wherein theſe things are recorded, and yet may have this kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. But though in humane affairs it be weakneſs and folly for a man to give up his judgment, and to captivate his underſtanding to what another ſaith, yet it is the excellency of Faith. And therefore it is ſaid in <hi>John</hi> 6.45. that they are learned men who do hear and learn of the Father; <hi>Every one that hears and learns of the Father comes unto me.</hi> He is a learned man (in the judgment of God) that goes by hear-ſay. That Faith is more to be eſteemed that is grounded upon the Scripture, than that Faith which is aſſiſted by diſcourſe and by reaſon. And the reaſon of it is this, becauſe that Faith is only dependant upon the teſtimony of God. Among Schollars and Miniſters you ſhall many times find a great deal more of knowledg than in others in the matter of divinity, but leſs Faith, Becauſe the Hearers go only by the Scripture, and the Teachers go by parts and Books: They go by the authority of God in the Scripture. Reaſon may be aſſiſtant unto Faith: But it deſtroys Faith as it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We have the mind of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: We have the better of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have the mind of Chriſt: And if you have all the ſubtilty and curioſity, and heigth, and depth which naturall underſtanding can reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:159991:81"/>to, yet know that we are contented with this, that we take things barely as they are reported unto us by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now this is that which Beleevers do cheerfully. He is willing to be a Fool, willing to have his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding denied, that he may receive the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or report of God, either concerning his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or concerning Gods good will concerning him, or his duty.</p>
               <p>And ſo take the other part of Faith as it is in the will, A reſting and quieting of the Soul in Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo a Beleever is willing thereunto. It is a great matter to be ſo, as I have ſhewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: It is a mean thing in its ſelf for a man to live dependantly, &amp; to have nothing but from hand to mouth. All a mans Glory, and confidence, and boaſting is excluded thereby. But though a man be nothing, and though a man be rendred vile and mean in the Eyes of God and all good men, yet Faith makes a man willing thereunto. A Soul that is converted had rather have its Good in Chriſts hands, than in its own; rather have its comforts in Chriſts giving and diſpoſing, than in its own; that he ſhould keep the Bottle, and give it as he thinks good: It would not be its own Carver, if it might. Obſerve it; So far as there is Faith unfeigned in a man, he had rather be at Gods carving, and Gods allowance for Grace, and comfort, and aſſiſtance, and ſupply, than at its own. Therefore ſee how cheerfully <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks concerning this caſe, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know whom I have beleeved:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, though that it be not in my own hand, yet it is in his hand that is able. Though I have not that which makes me to abound, and to be as if I were in Heaven, yet I know whom I have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and that he will keep it for me.</p>

               <p>FOr the further diſcovery therefore of this joy and Faith wherein this willingneſs to beleeve, and love of Chriſt appears, I ſhall name theſe ſix particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt: Wherever there is true Faith in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the Soul doth love to hear the Doctrine of faith &amp; of Jeſus Chriſt. Of al truths, that is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: And moſt pleaſing not only becauſe it's moſt profitable but becauſe it's moſt ſelf-denying. If ſo be the Soul would make its choice, or call for any thing out of the Book of God before another, it ſhould be for ſomthing that laies open Chriſt, and preſſeth beleeving on him. <hi>How beautifull are the Feet of them that bring glad tidings?</hi> Rom. 10.15. How beautifull? that is. they are as lovely as can be, Nay ſo lovely as no words are able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs: How beautifull? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did deſire to know nothing among the Corinthians, <hi>but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified;</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. that is, he deſired to make nothing elſe known. And look what it was in him preaching, ſo in every Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:159991:82"/>In <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. <hi>That I may know him, and the power of his Death, and the vertue of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Theſe things a man loves, and he loves to hear ſpoken of, and diſcourſed of. Evil men therefore do love corrupt words and unſavory language. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers they love to hear of Jeſus Chriſt; His name is ſweet and precious: Not only to hear of him as a ſtory, but as a perſon whereof there is need, and of whom there is uſe, and abſolute neceſſity unto ſalvation. Firſt I ſay the heart loves to hear of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.42. When the Apoſtle had preached in the name of Chriſt, all that were good came to him, and prayed him to preach that over the next Sabbath day, or as it is in ſome tranſlations between this and the next Sabbath day, as the word may well be rendred. And he did as you may read there. As in <hi>John</hi> 6. they cryed out ever more give us this bread, ſo the poor Soul deſires to hear of that again and again. When <hi>Lidia</hi> heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe attended as one that would not loſe a fillable, nor a word of what was ſpoken concerning jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. <hi>How heau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull</hi> (as I ſaid before) <hi>are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of peace.</hi> It is good to love the Law of God which teacheth a man his duty, like one that is carefull to do his maſters will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. He meditates therein day and night: But it's a better ſign for a man to love the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; the glad tidings of him: As I ſhal ſhew you if I come to it, that there is not only as great honor given unto God thereby, but thereby a man if more humbled and abaſed in himſelf and made nothing, than by all that obedience which the Law requires, or by all that ſenſe of miſery that the Law works in us becauſe we have not done our duty. A man hath meaner thoughts of himſelf when he thinks he muſt beleeve or he cannot be ſaved, than he hath
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:159991:82"/>when he thinks if he be called to an account he muſt needs periſh becauſe he hath tranſgreſſed Gods Law. The ſoul loves that law, which ſhews its own face in a glaſs with al its ſpots upon it: But it loves that glaſs better, in which it beholds the face of God, For thereby it is tranſformed from Glory to Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. laſt. Out of a ſpirit of indignation and wrath againſt a mans ſelfe and ſin, a man is glad to heare any thing that can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf and his ſin: But out of a love of Chriſt, and out of the love of greater excellencies in Chriſt then is in a mans ſelf, a man is glad to heare rather of Chriſt, then of himſelf, <hi>his name is as ointment powred forth. Cant.</hi> 1.3, There is nothing in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but what is ſweet, and as hony; But the Goſpel is as the hony-comb. The whole ſcripture is as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gared cup, But the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is as the bottom of that cup.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Where ever there is true faith, there is a deſire and longing after Faith and Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>As new borne babes,</hi> as the Text ſaith in 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. A deſire formally. O Lord ſaid the Diſciples unto Jeſus Chriſt, increaſe our faith. O Lord that we may receive our ſight. For its faith alone that makes us ſee the things freely given us of God, and to know the treaſury of grace and mercy which doth and hath lain hid from eternity. And ſo there is alſo a vertual deſire after Chriſt in al beleevers, They long after the meanes whereby faith is wrought. If you have raſted how good the Lord is, <hi>As new borne babes, you wil deſire the ſincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby.</hi> Though that a Child cannot diſtinguiſh rationally between the Milk of the breaſt, and that which is ſugared, It cannot tel that this is the one and this is the other, But it hath a taſt by which it can, and nothing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth but the mothers breaſt. The Child cannot
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:159991:83"/>ask for it, nor deſcribe it, but you may know it loves it becauſe it is ſtilled with it, and quieted with it. So may be the caſe of many a Chriſtian: He may not be able by reaſon, or by diſcourſe, or argument to make out the deſirableneſs of Jeſus Chriſt above al other things, the excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt above al other waies: There may be Rhetorick put upon al other things, beyond al that which he can ſee through, or put upon the things of Jeſus Chriſt, But you wil find his heart quieted with nothing but Jeſus Chriſt. Let him pray with never ſo much in largedneſs and affections, &amp; let him hear with never ſo much underſtanding, and live with never ſo much unblameableneſs in the world, yet al this is nothing, his heart is unquiet, becauſe it is not according to what the law requires: And if he ſees no fault in it, yet there is fault which the pure eyes of God behold when he comes to look it through and through: And he hath no peace but when he comes to beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive peace from him. What is there in al the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſalvation which thou longeſt after? What is it which thou wouldeſt carry home with thee? Is it ſomthing that may draw Jeſus Chriſt nearer to thee and make him more lovely to thee? So much thou mayeſt conceive of hope of thy ſtate of Salvation. The Love of Jeſus Chrſt is deſcribed by this, that nothing gives the heart ſo much quiet, and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is the heart ſo much taken up and contented, as it is with this, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediator, and undertaker, and is the ſurety, and doth al with the father: And that It doth do al with the father by him. The heart being pleaſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, argues the deſire to be after him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Where ever there is faith there is love even a high eſteeme of Jeſus Chriſt, and God the father in him, and a high valuation of him as one
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:159991:83"/>that is good, and true, and able, and liberal. Not only an acknowledgment of theſe vertues to be in him, but an eſtimation of him for them. And the reaſon is this. There is no one (you know) can beleeve or truſt another, whom (though he doth know to be able to diſcharge his promiſe, yet) he doth not eſteem of. No wiſe man (you know) wil truſt him whom he judges to be vain and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of his word, that wil ſpeak any thing. If ſo be any one makes a promiſe, and be not known to be rich, and beſides that to be powerful, ſo as none can hinder him from the fulfilling of it: If he be not eſteemed good, and liberal, that wil not think much of what he parts withal, We wil not truſt him. In faith therefore there is a love of the Glory of God. And ſo you have it deſcribed in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.21. <hi>That</hi> Abraham <hi>did beleeve, and give Glory unto God.</hi> While he was meditating on the promiſe, and the difficulty of receiving, and it came into his mind, yet he ſaid again, though that I be weak, yet he is able, &amp; though that I be dead yet he lives for ever: &amp; though that unto me, there belongs no ſuch mercy, yet he is liberal. Such indeed our faith in God is, as our eſteem is of God. As our eſteem is of God, ſuch is our love. Where we ſee little of excellency, there is little love: &amp; where we ſee much, there is much love. It is a peece of love, A duty &amp; an act of love w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the ſoul ſhews unto God that it wil ſuffer no blame to light upon him, that it wil have nothing, I ſay nothing imputed or charged upon his account, but he muſt ſtand fair and cleer, and without blem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and ſpot in al that ever he ſaith and doth, what ever becomes of the ſoul. Nay ſaith a beleever in this caſe, The fault is not in God but in me, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lyes not in any want of love in him, but in the folly and careleſsneſs of my own ſpirit. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why I want any thing is not becauſe I deſire any thing of God which he is not ready prepared to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:159991:84"/>doing of, but it is only becauſe I have a withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart. That is the third thing.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: The Soul that doth willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, doth even ſuffer it ſelf to be wrought upon by God if he pleaſe unto Jeſus Chriſt, It leaves it ſelf in the hand of God to be wrought upon even as he pleaſeth. That whereas before it was wont to murmur, and repine, and think much; and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God would take nothing but ſatisfaction, and be pacified by no means but by the blood of his Son: Now it ſaith, Let the Lord do with me even what he pleaſeth, ſo he will but unite me to, and make me one with Jeſus Chriſt. He puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like Clay into the hands of him, that He may frame and faſhion the Spirit according to his own mind. You have the expreſſion concerning <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, in <hi>Math.</hi> 3. When Chriſt came to him to be baptized, ſaid <hi>John, Do you come unto me? Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to be ſo,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for ſo it becomes us to fulfill all righteouſneſs, and then he ſuffered him.</hi> So the Soul is brought by God unto this, to let, or ſuffer God to confute what reaſoning he pleaſeth in him, to ſuggeſt ſuch apprehenſions as are contrary to his own ſenſe and imagination. In <hi>John</hi> 6.53. Chriſt told them that if they did not eat his Fleſh, and drink his blood, they had no ſhare in him: and the Text ſaith that many did murmur at the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And ſuch is the temper of the heart of man when Chriſt comes to deal with him about ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that he is offended at him, at the Call he gives; and is offended that he will not allow him any confidence, or comfort in any thing or for any thing that he hath done. Muſt there be ſo much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall vertue required to obtain eternall life, or it muſt not be had? As a Patient is told by the Phyſitian ſomtimes, You muſt ſo many daies take this courſe, forbear this diet, and take theſe bitter
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:159991:84"/>Pils: He begins to think he is injuriouſly dealt withall: But the Phyſitian tels him, if you will not take this courſe, you will die. Then he lets him do what he will. So the Soul ſaith unto Jeſus Chriſt, Lord take any courſe in the world with me: If thou wilt have me to lie down in ſorrow, If thou wilt have me be without thoſe means and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhings that I have had heretofore: If it be thy pleaſure that I ſhall lie upon thorns, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what I have done before, do what thou wilt, Only ſave me in the day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. As a man ſaith to a Phyſitian whom he hath a long time refuſed to be directed by the Counſel of, ſaith he, I do even ſubmit my ſelf to you, preſcribe what you pleaſe, uſe your own method, take what courſe your wiſdom thinks good, Let the things you give be bitter, and let the things you with-hold from me be never ſo good, as Air, or food: So the Soul leaves it ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, and lets him do with it what he will, which was the caſe of <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6, <hi>Lord what would'ſt that I do?</hi> Lord what wouldſt thou that I do? do thou have care of me, for I have none of my ſelf, I give up my ſelf to thee.</p>
               <p>Fifthly: The Soul is exceeding glad and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed when it can do any thing to take away its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and its ſupport that it hath any where, but only in Jeſus Chriſt. I ſay the Soul is glad that it hath nothing to help it, but Faith, and that Faith hath nothing to lean upon, but only Jeſus Chriſt. When one ſtone is not left upon another of all that which a man hath built to reſt himſelf in: When as the pillows are pluckt from under the head, and a man is left (as it were) dying, and from under the elbow, that a man hath nothing to ſupport him, yet then the Soul takes pleaſure &amp; contentment. There is a pleaſure &amp; contentment to have all ſweet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:159991:85"/>taken from a man that it may feed alone upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when it can convince its ſelf that in ſuch a courſe there wil be no ſafety nor ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation found, it rejoyceth exceedingly. <hi>We have no confidence in the fleſh,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.</note> but rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce when we have no confidence in the fleſh. It is ſaid concerning the Saints, that they waſh their feet in the bloud of the ungodly, and when the vengeance overtakes them, they ſay, This is the man that made not God his refuge, but truſted in his riches. As it is in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.6.7. ſaid of <hi>Doeg.</hi> So doth the Soul Glory and inſult over, all its vain confidences when they are taken from him: You are wel enough ſerved, and this is you that would truſt to praying, and to hearing, and that would put your confidence in externall performances; See what they come unto, and what they wil do: All are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, But oaken leaves that ſeemes to be ſilver, they are but appearances, and give no reall ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. You are well enough ſerved (ſaith the Soul unto it ſelf) and it is but juſtice that is done you, and I am glad it is ſo, and take your portion and ſhare. Whereas men are wont to complain in the world, that ſuch a Miniſter hath undone ſuch a perſon, he hath caſt him into the extreameſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of heart that can be. They were comforted, but now they cry out they are undone, &amp; undone: They cry out of nothing but this, that they have truſted to this &amp; that &amp; another thing. And in this a Beleever would rejoyce. Bleſſed be God, that I uſe al means, but it is as if I uſed them not, I will truſt to none: Bleſſed be God that I have got my heart to ſee that whatſoever it is which ſeems to be a glorious ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, yet I ſee it will fail me: But in Jeſus Chriſt there is ſtrength. What a pleaſure is it to a godly man to think how God hath purſued his Soul, and frited him and made him to run from al the ſhelters
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:159991:85"/>wherein he would hide himſelf. When a man comes to make his relation before God in prayer and ſaith, I would have run into this houſe, and have reſted in this Company, and ſetled upon this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and yet the Lord followed me again and again: This is a refreſhment to him, and glads him. When another ſaith it would make a man caſt off all care of goodneſs for to tell him, that when he hath done all things, there is not a penny paid, nor one nick cut off from the talley of the Lord, when they ſay this is the way to make a man caſt the Commandments of God behind his back, He ſaith, bleſſed be God that would not let me take common Bail, which would not have ſtood my Soul in ſtead. In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks home to this purpoſe. <hi>I was a Blaſphemer and a Perſecutor, and injurious, but God vouchſafed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to me.</hi> And how was that? you know in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. and <hi>Acts</hi> 22. God beats him down off his Horſe, and a light from Heaven did ſhine about him, and he was caſt upon the ground, and told that he had nothing to do with the Jews that perſecuted Chriſt. But thou perſecuteſt <hi>me Paul:</hi> The more you ſtrive, the more you wound and deſtroy your own Soul, Now mark what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Now unto the King immortall, and inviſible, and only wiſe God, be Glory for ever Amen.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Bleſſed be God that knockt me down, and bleſſed be God that ſpake thoſe words, and for ever praiſed be his name that he would make me to lie with my mouth in the duſt, and to have no hope in the earth: As he ſpeaks in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father that hath thought us meet to be brought out of darkneſs into his marvelous light.</hi> To be pluckt as it were by the hair of the head out of one condition into another. So <hi>Math.</hi> 13.44. The man that found the treaſure in the Field,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:159991:86"/>went and ſold all, and did it with joy: As if he ſhould have ſaid, I am glad I have nothing in all the world but this Field, this Chriſt, and nothing but this converſion, and that ſhall ſatisfie me. And therefore in this caſe, becauſe a Beleever is glad to have his confidence in the fleſh thrown down. As it was the ſpeech of <hi>Jobs</hi> friends in <hi>Job</hi> 34.36. <hi>My deſire is that Job may be tried to the utmoſt:</hi> As if they ſhould have ſaid, Lord do not ſpare <hi>Job</hi> till thou haſt made him to know that it is a righteous thing with thee to do with him as thou wilt, though he hath not been an Hypocrite, Try him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: Juſt ſo in the like caſe, when a Beleever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be taken off from confidence in himſelf, he praies, Lord let it be a through work: Lord, go to the root of this pride, and cut it off at the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and leave nothing but what is of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixtly &amp; Laſtly: When the Soul doth once come to know that it hath by Faith received Chriſt, and is Received of Chriſt, then its joy is full. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.4. <hi>Our fellowſhip is with the Father and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and I write this that your joy may be full.</hi> It is not every one that hath ful joy, that hath fellowſhip with Chriſt, but he that hath fellowſhip with Chriſt and the Father too; that ſees (if I may ſo expreſs it to you) the Father in Chriſt, and through Chriſt, as in a glaſs ſmiling upon him, then its joy is ful. Ful, that is pure. As we uſe to ſay that is ful Wine which is unmixt, and ſtrong, Then he rejoyceth in nothing elſe but only in God &amp; Jeſus Chriſt. Full, that is, ſtrong, that it makes a man do much in a little: To value no difficulties in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that it raviſheth a man, that he is dead to all things beſides. Even as the Women that ſaw our Lord Jeſus Chriſt after he roſe from the dead, they fel about his head &amp; held and kiſſed him and would
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:159991:86"/>not let him go. Full, that is, his joy is great, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, as the Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. ſuch as no word can expreſs. It cannot be compared to the joy of him that doth divide the ſpoyl, nor to the joy of him that reaps the harveſt. When men have corn and Wine and Oyl increaſe, then they are glad: But ſaith he, We ſhal have more joy in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. when thou lifteſt up the light of thy countenance. It is joy that is ful of Glory. Glory, that is, Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Majeſty, ſo as no mean and low thoughts and pleaſures will take with a man. It is full of Glory, that is, it ſatisfies the Soul, As he that is full deſpiſeth the honey combe. So he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly look upon al thoſe things which other men take pleaſure in beſides. In other duties (I beſeech you mark it beloved) the Soul hath a taſt of Heaven, and a beginning and dawning of Glory. But when a man comes to know that he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt by Faith, then he is full of Glory, that is, he is even as if he were in Heaven it ſelf, as if he were in that compleat happineſs which ſhall abide to eternity. I have enough ſaid the Patriarch <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> when he heard that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a live. So ſaith the Soul I have enough, for Chriſt is mine, and I am Chriſts. The Iſraelites when they came out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, they were like men that dreamed: The things were too good to be be true: They were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a rapture as it were. So doth the Soul in this caſe, Sometimes it admires: What is this? (ſaid <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come unto me? Much more doth the Soul ſay, What is this that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come to be in my Cottage, in my underſtanding, ſo poor and mean a one as mine is? <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.12. <hi>The accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the deſire is as a Tree of life:</hi> It was a ſign unto it that it ſhould live. So the Soul ſaith, Evil ſhal depart from me, the ſins that I have been troubled
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:159991:87"/>with ſhall be mortified, Weakneſſes ſhall be repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I ſhall no more lie down in ſorrow. My belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the man that watcheth for the morning, and as the Child that waits for the full age, and as the Joy of the Bride and Bridegroom: All theſe the Scripture uſeth, and much more is the joy of the Soul, when it ſees, and feels, and finds Jeſus Chriſt. But this I ſay is that which it comes unto. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five particulars are thoſe which more concerns the Point in hand: But at this laſt, they all drive, and at this they do all arrive, but in their ſeaſon.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>NOW conſider that this muſt be for three or four Reaſons. I ſay the Soul muſt be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and willing to receive Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt: In this true Grace is diſtinguiſhed from that which is not true, but is like unto it. It is that which changeth the nature, and becomes a kind of nature. In 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine nature.</hi> And that acts of it ſelf, and that prompts and puts on to do according to it. A Stone when it is out of its center and place, hath a naturall inſtinct to move thitherto. The Fire
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:159991:87"/>would be upward, becauſe it is its nature. Look how ſin is in a man, ſo Grace is in a Saint, for it comes in the ſtead of that. Sin is not the eſſence of a man, It is not his ſoul, yet it is ſo wrought into his ſoul, that he doth as naturally ſin, as he doth naturally apprehend, or think, or do a rational act. So now, Grace is not the ſoul of a man, but it is ſo infuſed and created in it, as that the ſoul doth as willingly the things of God according unto its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as it doth its rational acts, or as it did its ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acts formerly: I ſay according to its meaſure. For there is more ſin at firſt then grace in any man that is converted.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40.</note> The ſcripture therefore ſpeaks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, <hi>I wil put my fear into your heart</hi> And what then, This grace ſhal have the power of a cauſe, and that ſhal worke you according to it ſelf. Fear, ſhal make you fear, and faith ſhal make you beleeve, and to beleeve naturally. Common grace is not wrought into the nature, nor become a nature and therefore hence it comes that men do looſe it, and ſal unto their natural courſe, As the dog unto his vomit, and the ſow to the wallowing in the Mire, as the ſcripture ſpeakes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By this willingneſs to beleeve, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and Corrupt diſputing of the ſoul againſt Jeſus Chriſt, comes to be ſilenced altogether or in a very great meaſure. 2 Cor. 10.5. <hi>The Apoſtle ſaith that every thought and imagination ſhal be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated to the obedience of faith.</hi> To the obedience of faith. Now it is captivated by the love which a man hath unto faith. You al know that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure to have that reaſoned againſt which we love: we are preſently put into a paſſion if any one wil go to vilifie or ſpeake againſt that which we have a mind unto. Now when the ſoul hath a mind to go unto Jeſus Chriſt, and a mind to beleeve, the nit ſtops its eare, and doth
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:159991:88"/>withdraw its ſenſe and apprehenſion from what ever can be ſaid againſt it. According as its mind is to beleeve, ſo deafneſs growes upon it to al the reaſonings of the fleſh, for continuance in any other ſtate without Jeſus Chriſt. If a man hath a mind to any meat, or to do a thing, he wil ſay, ſpeak no more, I am reſolved to do it, I wil venture And ſo doth the ſoul in this caſe. And its the beſt way of confutation of arguments. As the Apoſtle ſaith, God forbid. So confute them with this, I wil beleeve, and I wil go unto Jeſus Chriſt, what ever you ſay I am reſolved on that. That is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reaſon. The murmuring and diſputing that are againſt faith wil not be quiet and ceaſe til they come to have ſuch an affection to beleeve.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Until you wil be in beleeving, or til you love to beleeve, your faith is not ſaving. For faith is an applying of Jeſus Chriſt to a mans ſelf,</p>
               <p>There is a double application of Jeſus Chriſt to a mans ſelf.</p>
               <p>The one is in diſcourſe, when a man can conclude himſelf to be one of Chriſts. And that is faith of aſſurance.</p>
               <p>And the other, is not by diſcourſe, but by aime and intention. When a man doth go unto Jeſus Chriſt for good unto himſelf. Now mark what I ſay. Al the credit that you give unto the word, Al the ſence that you ſubſcribe unto, the promiſes of the Goſpel, Theſe do not apply Chriſt to you, No more (you know) then for a man to meditate on the treaſures of the King of ſpain, do make his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his, or do give him an intereſt in it. When a man loves faith, and loves Chriſt, then he gives up himſelf to Chriſt that he may be his. A man looks not from Chriſt for any thing to himſelf until he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:159991:88"/>doth by an act of the Wil reſt upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Laſtly: There muſt be this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of love in beleeving, becauſe the Soul muſt <hi>acquieſce</hi> and reſt So in Chriſt, as to ſeek help no where elſe. Now that he muſt So <hi>acquieſce</hi> is evident by this, becauſe to go to Jeſus Chriſt, or to receive Chriſt and not as the only Savior,, is to diſhonor him. A man cannot reſt in him as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Savior, unleſs that he doth approve, and like of, and take pleaſure in, that which the Goſpel hath revealed concerning him. Or more plainly thus. That way which a man doth not approve, a man wil not ſtick unto for the ſalvation of his Soul. That a man may therefore ſtick unto Chriſt, and never depart from him, he muſt have a good will or liking or approbation of him. And ſo much ſhal now ſuffice for the Doctrinal part of this Point.</p>

                  <p>Application. <hi>Then there are but few Receivers of Jeſus Chriſt. This <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe concerns three ſorts of Perſons.</hi> 1. <hi>Such as do not receive Jeſus Chriſt as he is.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>IS Faith ſuch a kind of Receiving? then truly it will caſt even all the world almoſt. There are but few Receivers of Jeſus Chriſt. Many to whom he is offered, but few that give him entertainment by Faith. And thoſe that have given him enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, have not done according to the Law of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:159991:89"/>that duty in receiving him with that kindneſs, which he ſhould have been entertained with. I ſhal put both theſe ſorts together, becauſe they are both under one reproof, though not both under the ſame danger.</p>
               <p>Firſt: I ſay this Point diſcovers many to be under unbelief, and ſo not to be the Sons of God, but the wrath of God to abide upon them. And that even many of thoſe who do live under the Goſpel, &amp; have beleeved &amp; received Chriſt, but not received him with love; As the Apoſtle ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, you have not ſo learned Chriſt, So may I ſay they have not ſo received Chriſt. They have received him, but not as a friend, and not as a gueſt and not as one that loves him: But even as ſomtimes a poor Child is taken to keeping, becauſe they are compelled thereunto by Law, and they cannot rid themſelves of that charge. So men are compelled by their light and conviction to beleeve that there is no way for ſalvation but by Jeſus Chriſt; Their Underſtanding is forced to receive in this truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhines ſo cleerly: As the light that opens the ſleeping mans eyes that lies againſt it; but they do not love him. In <hi>John</hi> 3.19. <hi>They loved dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light, becauſe their works were evill.</hi> Loved darkneſs more than light. Jeſus Chriſt is that light and Faith is that ſight whereby we ſee that light, and they love darkneſs, that is, they love even the moſt uncomfortable eſtate that they could be in the world, better then they love the way of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, darkneſs in the Scripture is referred to uncomfortableneſs. Whether you refer it to the darkneſs of the ſhadow under the Law, Or to the darkneſs of heavineſs and grief of Spirit wherein men are put when they apprehend what they have done to the deſtruction of their Souls. Men love any thing (darkneſs) rather than Jeſus Chriſt.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:159991:89"/>I ſhall have occaſion to open that again, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paſs it over ſhortly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings thou haſt ordained praiſe, that thou maieſt ſtill the avenger and the enemy,</hi> Pſal. 8.2. And who is the Enemy and the Avenger? It is only the naturall man. For in the <hi>Hebrews</hi> you ſhall find that the eighth Pſalme is only a Prophecy of Jeſus Chriſt under whoſe feet. God puts all things, Jeſus Chriſt was the praiſe of God the Father, becauſe he was as unfit to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken and perfected the work of our ſalvation in the eyes of the world, as a Child is unfit to do the ſervice of a man. Or, as the language of a Child is inſignificant, and is not able to expreſs it ſelf. Now why will God take ſuch a courſe? That he may ſtill he Enemy and the Avenger. That I would have you note. That there is in men an enmity and a rage againſt Jeſus Chriſt and the way of ſalvation by him. If there were any thing he would deſtroy, and if there were any wall he would pluck down, and if there were any truth, he would deny, namely ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</hi> His own, that is, thoſe that were ſeparated from the reſt of the world. As we call that a mans own wherein a man hath a particular intereſt, title, and poſſeſſion. If they were Chriſts own, then they had in ſome meaſure owned him, as wel as he had owned them. They had owned him by profeſſion, and yet they received him not, becauſe they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not with love. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the word ſignifies properly a receiving kindly, and reſpectively and gladly. So, they received him not. The Jews they thought they had received the Meſſiah, when they refuſed the Meſſiah. They thought that he that ſhould be the Meſſiah ſhould be ſuch a one, and becauſe Chriſt came not cloathed like unto him,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:159991:90"/>therefore they rejected him. So Chriſtians are apt to a great miſtake about Jeſus Chriſt preached and born in the Goſpell, (as I may ſay) as the Jews were about him when that he came in the Fleſh. I ſhall inſtance only in one.</p>
               <p>They do not love beleeving, nor receive Jeſus Chriſt with love: who beleeve him not to be ſuch a one as he is: who receive him not according to the greatneſs and glory with which he is inveſted, and which belonges unto him. Suppoſe a Noble man ſhould come unto a mans houſe, and be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but as an ordinary man: Let his entertainment be otherwiſe what it wil be, he is not uſed kindly, but you do degrade him, and level him to an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary mans condition, when as he is a perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Kind uſage of one lyes in the ſhewing him that reſpect and eſteem which belongs unto him. He is an unkind man to his wife, who reſpects her but as his Father and Mother, when as he muſt leave Father and Mother in his affections in compariſon of her. So now, he uſeth Chriſt unkindly, and he doth not ſhew his love by beleeving on him, who doth not by faith receive him as he is God and Man, One in whoſe hands al power is, &amp; may do what he pleaſeth, viz. (Give the ſpirit from the father) And one who is holy, and harmleſs, and ſeparate from ſinners: I ſay, unleſs you beleeve upon him as ſuch a one, and receive him as ſuch a one, and love him as ſuch a one, then you do not beleeve, In 1 <hi>Rom.</hi> 21. <hi>They Glorifyed him not as God, and therefore God gave them up to vile affections.</hi> They Glorified God, he confeſſeth, But not as God, and therefore they were puniſhed. Wherein lay that, that they glorified him not as God; It lay in this, God had put forth his power and wiſdom in the things that he had made, and they ſet up things which they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:159991:90"/>made in the memorial of that God, but they prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him not as a God of infinite power: They look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after no more then was in the creation and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not giving infinite power to him, they Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him not as God. So I ſay here, They do not love Jeſus Chriſt as Chriſt, who do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg him to be what indeed he is, and to be ſuch a one as he is revealed. I ſhall ſpeak more plainly thus. The Jews did ſtumble at the meaneſs of Chriſts out-ſide, becauſe they looked by him to have a temporall kingdome. There are as falſe &amp; as erronious apprehenſions of Chriſt in the minds of men now. The dealings of Chriſt with the Souls of men, are as contrary and as unanſwerable unto mens expectations and preſumptions, as the mean coming of Jeſus Chriſt into the world was contrary unto the expectation of the Jews. Mark it. Chriſts dealings with the Spirits of men, are as unanſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as his coming in the Fleſh was unanſwerable to what the Jews expected. When ever Jeſus Chriſt comes, he comes as a King, he will be Lord, or nothing. As Kings when they come into private mens houſes, command all their ſervants as their own, and uſe every roome as if they that owed them had nothing to do with them: They take all power out of their hands for the preſent, and uſe nothing but what they bring with them, and that which is of their own providing. So when Jeſus Chriſt is come into the Soul, he will have every thought after his mind, and not give a man leave ſo much as to look after any other thing than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Men look not for ſuch a kind of thing as this is by Chriſt, and therefore they are not able to endure it. Men look for eaſe, and not to be kept to their duty, and they look for peace, and not for to be under the reproof and corrections and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Lord. And men look to have their
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:159991:91"/>good will accepted, and that Jeſus Chriſt will be ſerved with nothing of what is ours, but of what he gives. Or rather thus, when Jeſus Chriſt comes unto men, he brings trouble, <hi>Behold a Sword:</hi> He changeth men from what they were, and takes them off from the practiſes wherein they walked, which they thought were good. As when Jeſus Chriſt came, he nulled all the ſervices of the Jews, which they thought were exceeding Glorious. Now Jeſus Chriſt comes and ſets the ax at the root of the Tree, and ſaith, If we will not bring forth Fruit, we ſhall be cut down. Now the Soul looks not for any ſuch thing as this. What are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of men by Jeſus Chriſt, but only that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be a Chariot, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould give him his hand to ſit by him in Heaven? Men look that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come with his Arms ready to receive them, and his Boſom to lay them in: They look for nothing but what may make their lives more free, and their Spirits more quiet than they were before. You will be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in receiving Chriſt: If you have peace with him, you ſhall have trouble. You ſhall be a King and reign, but he will be a King and reign over you. He will be ſerved by you, but you ſhall take all from his Treaſure, that you may ſay only as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did, <hi>Of thy own do I ſerve thee.</hi> Now this being contrary to mens apprehenſions, they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to it, and being not willing to it, they are not believing.</p>
               <p>If Jeſus Chriſt be not received according to that Glory which he hath, and which doth belong to him, (Make as much of him as you will) yet ſtill it will not be ſalvation to you. <hi>We ſaw his Glory</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, (when he preached) <hi>as the Glory of the only begotten Son of God,</hi> John 1.14. <hi>[As]</hi> that is, it was no other Glory, and can be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:159991:91"/>counted no other Glory but what belongs unto God himſelf. Now as Jeſus Chriſt is preached and known, ſo he muſt be received by the hearers. There is nothing that is worſhip and honor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, nothing that will make us happy, but what is done unto God and Chriſt, as ſuch. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes this in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. to be a ſign of the effectuall calling and converſion of the Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, That they received the word, not as the word of man, but as it was indeed the word of God. As the word muſt be received as Gods word indeed, ſo muſt Jeſus Chriſt be received as he is indeed. Look therefore what Jeſus Chriſt muſt be that he may be the Author of ſalvation, you muſt receive him as ſuch, if your Faith be ſaving. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary if he would ſave us, that he ſhould be God and Man: that he ſhould be the head of al things: that he ſhould be holy and ſeparate from ſinners. Do you now receive him by Faith as ſuch a one? Doth your Faith cloſe with him gladly under theſe reſpects? It is not enough to ſaving Faith that you do not deny him to be thus, but he muſt be owned by you to be thus. I ſay he muſt be owned by you. A man may under one conſideration be wonderfull kind and reſpectfull to a Perſon, when under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration he will ſhew no reſpect to him. As for example. They ſaid unto <hi>Lot</hi> that he came in among them to ſojourn, and would have Lorded it over them. That is, (as if they ſhould have ſaid) If <hi>Lot</hi> will live among us, and take his being with us as an ordinary Perſon, he may: But if he thinks all things muſt be as he wil, If he will trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with our matters, and order al things according to his Will, and be our Governor, we wil have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with him. Therefore the Apoſtle faith of ſome men, that they love him not as a Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>If a man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:159991:92"/>him be accurſed.</hi> They love him as Chriſt, for ſo he is anointed: and as Jeſus for ſo he is a Savior: But this <hi>[Lord]</hi> being added, makes their hearts to riſe againſt him, and againſt the precious oin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Graces that are in him. And ſo you ſhal find in <hi>Jude</hi> 4. He ſaith, <hi>there are ſome that do deny the Lord.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, uſed for a <hi>[Lord]</hi> is a Maſter of a family: If Jeſus Chriſt will come, and he wil have all our time, and ſtrength, and not only that, but the things that are done muſt be after his order, and according to his mind: Our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and reaſon muſt not direct us in the things that we do, though they be materially good: If ſo, the Text ſaith, <hi>They deny him:</hi> that is, They profeſs they will not have ſuch a one to rule over them. And thus if you compare it carefully in <hi>Luke</hi> 20. from 9. to 17. verſe, with <hi>Math.</hi> 21. where the ſame parable is repeated, though thoſe that had the Vineyards let out to them were angry with the ſervants, yet they uſed them not ſo il, as they uſed the Son: And why did they uſe him ſo ill? It was only becauſe he was the heir, and would have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over them. <hi>We will not</hi> (ſay they) <hi>have this man rule over us.</hi> And therefore as Perſons are wont to enquire what the quality and diſpoſition of thoſe are, with whom they deſire to marry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make any treaty or Covenant with them. A wiſe Man or Woman firſt ſits down and conſider, whether they can like a Man or Woman of ſuch a Spirit and behavior: Suppoſe him to be dull, and harſh, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her deſire. So firſt get the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt as he is one that ſaves, and then exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves how you can ſubmit unto him, that you may judg whether your Faith be true or not. Can you ſubmit unto Chriſt as God, having all things of himſelf, and having an abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:159991:92"/>on him for all? Can you receive him as your Lord and head? and therefore ſay as <hi>John</hi> did, he muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe, he muſt reign, and I muſt be put under his feet, and it is fit it ſhould be ſo: Yea, canſt thou receive him thus ſimply and not upon condition only or principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Rather than the Prodigall would ſtarve, he would ſerve, and ſerve in the meaneſt condition that could poſſibly be. Rather than he would die he would eat and feed with the Hogs. A great change, and altogether unlike the Spirit of ſuch a one as he was when he went out from his Father, that could not endure to live upon his Fathers curteſie, in hopes of his portion, but muſt have it in his own hands. Now as he did it out of neceſſity, ſo may men be ready to receive Jeſus Chriſt. But in ſuch a caſe as that is, it is a burden to a man, and unto Jeſus Chriſt alſo. For I beſeech you conſider it. If there be no greater cauſe or reaſon, why a man would have Jeſus Chriſt, than that he may be a Plaiſter to heal him of his ſores than that he may be life to recover him from the dead. (His life is dear to him, that is cleer, And his ſalvation is dear to him but) Jeſus Chriſt is only as a means to ſerve his turn, and ſo far he cannot but be deſired of a man. What man is there (as you ſhall hear by and by) that will take delight in Phyſick for it ſelf, or that doth not count it a miſery to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in Phyſick, though it be a means to preſerve his health. Salvation is to be looked for by Jeſus Chriſt, But Jeſus Chriſt eſpecially. When Faith gives entertainment unto Jeſus Chriſt, it alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ſalvation. As Chriſt ſaid unto <hi>Zacheus, This day ſalvation is come unto thy houſe:</hi> But Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the great and chief Gueſt. Faith (I ſay) bids welcome unto Chriſt and his benefits, but moſt of all unto himſelf. And ſo much
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:159991:93"/>now ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of that firſt ſort, ſuch as receive not Chriſt willingly, and therefore have no true Faith, becauſe they receive him not according to that Glory which he is of.</p>

                     <hi>Aſecond ſort of Perſons not Receivers of Jeſus Chriſt viz. Such as delay their coming to Chriſt. When delaies argue unwillingneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEcondly ſuch alſo as do delay and put off their going unto Jeſus Chriſt or cloſing with him. Delay argues unwillingneſs. So the Seller ſaith, A man hath no mind, he is not willing to lay out his money, by beating up and down he doth not make up his bargain.</p>
               <p>Again. Delaies are a kind of denials. And ſo the poor man takes them who cals and asks for an Alms, and receives no anſwer. In War, If men accept not of conditions by ſuch a time, they are counted enemies. God counts delaies, unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18. The Gueſts that are invited would not come, and yet if you look there, you ſhal ſee that they do but put off the matter for a while, for one ſaith, he had bought a yoak of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and another had other buſineſs, that he could not come. God counts you to be unwilling, when you are delaying.</p>
               <p>There is a forbearance which is not a delay. As the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe,</hi> though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laies his coming to judgment: becauſe he hath this great reaſon for it, viz. His elect are in the world, and muſt be born into it, that ſo they may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:159991:93"/>and ſaved by him. The Lord having ſo great a reaſon for his patience with the world, therefore he is not to be counted ſlack, though he lets things go diſorderly and without puniſhment for many years together, for what we can think. <hi>I</hi> may ſay now in the like caſe alſo, that a man doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to beleeve alwaies, becauſe he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? For there may be ſome reaſon for it. There is no reaſon can exempt a man from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation unto Faith. Its no reaſon at all for a man to ſay that becauſe he is poor and miſerable and under Gods diſpleaſure, or in his ſins, therefore he ſhould not beleeve. But though there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to exempt a man from the obligation of the Commandment of Faith, yet there is ſomthing to be done before the Act of Faith. That is, the heart muſt be humbled, and have the ſenſe of ſin, The ſenſe of ſin and of a mans need of Jeſus Chriſt, doth in order of nature precede &amp; go before this Act of reſting on him. He that hath no ſenſe of ſin, ought to ſay that it is my duty to beleeve: But he ought to ſay as well, That I may beleeve, I ought to ſee my ſins. Becauſe therefore there may be a reaſon, therefore every forbearance of believing is not a deniall.</p>
               <p>Nor doth every forbearance argue unwillingneſs. Every forbearance of a duty is not a ſign that a man is unwilling to a duty. As for example. A man makes his friend to ſtay at the door, or in ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe for a while before he goes out to him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the room wherein he would entertain him is not righted and made hanſome for him: And yet he may be as glad of his coming, as of any thing in the world. And yet make him ſtay till things be ready for his entertainment. So the Soul may be deſierous of Chriſt, and yet not think himſelf fit to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:159991:94"/>receive him as yet: A fault there may be in thee, and often times there is, Becauſe Jeſus Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for his own entertainment. As ſoon as ever the door is open, that is, that the heart be ſenſible of ſin, Jeſus Chriſt doth come in with all his furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, makes it an habitation for himſelf. If a man will ſtay from Jeſus Chriſt for want of one degree of Grace more than he hath, there is the ſame reaſon he ſhould ſtay for all degrees of Grace: for all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Grace are little enough to compaſs him with, or to give him entertainment.</p>
               <p>But though that forbearance argues not unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in all caſes, yet in ſundry caſes it doth. As for example. When we are not ſenſible, and take not notice of what is done by God and Chriſt to egge and draw out the Soul by Faith unto him: When no ſpurring will make us go on: Though we be exhorted, perſwaded, commanded, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, threatned, yet ſtill we ſtand where we were. Amazed at our miſery, but give not up our ſelves unto this Grace of Chriſt. Or if a man be moved and not proportionably unto the means that are uſed: Though he hath lived long, and been under the perſwaſion of the Goſpel continually, yet ſtill there is little, very little progreſs, or looking towards the Lord Jeſus. Like green wood, that though there be much fire, and earneſt blowing, yet retains nothing but only a little warmth, and comes not unto fire at all. Were it only a dulneſs and heavineſs, and ſlowneſs of ſpirit, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſr, the continuance of the means, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually ſpurred would remove that, and make us at length to get as much as might teſtifie and bear witneſs to our Souls that indeed we are in love with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Where (I ſay) continuall means and Ordinances do but very little, it is a ſign that there is not only ſlothfulneſs,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:159991:94"/>but unwillingneſs, that the Soul is not wrought upon effectually.</p>
               <p>But then eſpecially doth delay argue unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when a man ſtifles and hinders the working of the means. He pincheth in the pains that would deliver him of all his trouble: He weakens and enervates the Arguments that are brought to perſwade him to go to Jeſus Chriſt. He grows witty and wiſe and cunning to evade the Arguments and Reaſons of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And then again is a mans delay a ſign of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs, when he hath it in his power to beleeve, and yet doth not beleeve. I ſay when he hath it in his power. As it is a ſign a man is not willing to pay his debt, or to give unto the poor, when he hath it by him, and yet bids the poor or the debt or to come another time. In all that are regenerate there is a Spirit of Faith: And when they are under the means, and the means do affect them, it is then in their power to heleeve. Naturally no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: But it is given unto them that are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and they can bring that power into act when the means do work upon them. As now in the hearing of a Sermon, for a man to with-hold his Soul from Jeſus Chriſt, when the Ordinance preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, yet for him to keep his heart back from going unto him, that is a ſign of unwillingneſs.</p>
               <p>I wil mention but one delay more. And that is when a man keeps from Jeſus Chriſt without a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And let me tell you this, that if once a man ſee his ſin, and his own helpleſsneſs, there can be no Reaſon why he ſhould keep from Jeſus Chriſt. If there be any reaſon, It muſt be either in himſelf, or in Chriſt. If it be in himſelf, it muſt be one of theſe two things.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:159991:95"/>
               <p>Either the want of Grace.</p>
               <p>Or the abundance of corruption and guilt that lies upon him.</p>
               <p>If it be want of Grace. It muſt be,</p>
               <p>Either the totall want,</p>
               <p>Or the want of ſome degrees.</p>
               <p>The whole want of Grace that is no ground why you ſhould not beleeve, for by beleeving you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Grace for Grace. Grace is an effect of Faith: It is the bleſſing of that ſeed, and the Tree that grows upon that Plant.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be for want of ſome degree. For as I told you juſt now, There will be as much reaſon for a man when he hath attained to twenty degrees of Grace to ſtay ſtil til he hath attained to the laſt degree of Grace. as there will be for him when he hath one degree to ſtay til he hath twenty degrees: for al degrees of Grace are little enough to give Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt that reſpect which belongs unto him. If it be not therefore the want of Grace in whole, or in part that ſhould keep a man from believing, Is it the greatneſs of thy ſins? But</p>
               <p>Know that thy ſins are the greater by delaies. As the debt grows more by non-payment: Uſe, and Uſe upon Uſe. And the wound grows the worſe by not laying on the thing that may heal. Is not the reaſon then in thee? Nor in thy ſins, nor in thy Guilt: But in Jeſus Chriſt? That it cannot be. <hi>For the Bride ſaith come, and take of the waters of life freely,</hi> Revel. 22.17. And what can be more ſaid, or be more deſired? Jeſus Chriſt is glad when ſinners come to him: more glad than a godly man is of the converſion of another. As in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22.28. The Father was exceedingly rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced when the Prodigall came home, when the elder Brother was troubled at it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. <hi>The word is nigh thee even in thy mouth.</hi> It is nigh unto thee:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:159991:95"/>that is, It is throughly known, As we throughly know the things that are ſpoken in our Ears, the ſound that is not far off, but near. Now the word is nigh unto thee, even in thy mouth. As a thing that is confeſſed by al, we phraſe it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is in every mans mouth. Now it is in every mans mouth, and Jeſus Chriſt hath made it evident in his word, that whoſoever believs ſhall be ſaved. The word is nigh thee, and in thy mouth, that if thou beleeveſt thou ſhalt be ſaved. If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſon therefore that thou goeſt not unto Jeſus Chriſt, it muſt be thy own apprehenſion and thoughts. For there is none in the Object Jeſus Chriſt: nor any ſuch reaſon in thy ſelf. I ſay all the reaſon muſt be in thy own apprehenſion. And therefore thy apprehenſion is ſuch, becauſe indeed thy heart is unwilling to receive Jeſus Chriſt. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs formes and ſhapes and frames ſtrange apprehenſions in the Underſtanding. As where a man doth not love he wil find occaſions to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and Arguments as often as he thinks good to ingage and ſeparate his affections from that thing or Perſon.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially Beloved where there is a feigned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Mark what I ſay. Where there is a feigned reaſon there is unwillingneſs to receive Jeſus Chriſt. A Lyon, A Lyon ſaith the Sluggard is in the ſtreet.</p>
               <p>Men ſay that they ſhall be refuſed if they go unto God by Jeſus Chriſt for Faith. You do but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this: It's but a feigned reaſon for your unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs, for none ever went to him that received a neglectful Anſwer. In <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>Thoſe that come unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men think if they ſhould lay hold upon Ieſus Chriſt, they ſhould but flatter themſelves preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly, and their hearts would be hardned more.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:159991:96"/>It is but a feigned reaſon. For as fire ſoftens wax, ſo would the love of God ſoften thee. The appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the wrath of God hardens, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the love of God ſoftens.</p>
               <p>As men go up and down Markets and Faires and and think to do better til they have loſt their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; So do men put off, and put off to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve till the day of Grace be paſt. There is as great a hazard in delay, as in oppoſition or refuſal: and though it ſeems not unto the Conſcience to be ſo great a ſin, (but it is colored with modeſty, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and fear) yet not withſtanding it is as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. The Lord he reads the principle from whence it comes, and he judgeth of the Act acccor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto it. The means continuing and the heart being ſtirred, yet men find out ſome rub or other in the way, ſomthing or other to ſtop and delay their courſe of going unto, and cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt. It may be their ruine. It is as much as if they ſhould ſay, They would have none of Jeſus Chriſt, nor of his ſalvation. There are ſome men ſo fooliſh that they wil not ſend for the Phyſitian, nor take advice til the Diſeaſe hath gotten them down and they are overcome by it and weakned and brought unto the Grave. So it is a folly of Spirit that til we ſee all means periſhing, we wil not come unto a period, and put an end unto the diſpute and debate of our Spirits whether we ſhould beleeve or not.

When Chriſt was born, there was no room for him in the Inne, but in the Stable, and he was cradled in a Manger. And ſo now do men deal with Jeſus Chriſt in receiving him by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. There is a kind of beleeving which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving after that ſort. As for example.</p>
               <p>He is only taken into ſome mens mouths: Men ſpeak much of him, but their hearts are far from him, though they draw near to him with their lips.</p>
               <p>Some men have Jeſus Chriſt only in their Fancies and ſpeculations, only in their outward room and Fancy. The Fancy is unto the Soul as the Porch or outward Court is unto the Houſe: Or it is as a Shop or a Ware-houſe wherein Commodities are ſet forth, that ſo that thoſe that paſs by may be taken and allured by them. This is the nature of the Fancy of a man: Now Ieſus Chriſt is admitted no further with many men. That is. The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which they have by Chriſt is only by the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors and borrowed ſpeeches which the Scripture uſeth, and by which he is reſembled and ſet forth in the Scripture. Their knowledg of him, is not proper but Metaphoricall and figurative. For the better helping you in this, you muſt know that there are two ſorts of fanciful Faiths (if I may uſe that expreſſion) two ſorts of people that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Ieſus Chriſt only ſo far. 1. Such as hearing or reading in the Scripture that Ieſus Chriſt is Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Rock, and Bread, and Water of life, and unto a Tree of life, and ſet out as one that ſtands at the door or Gate of Heaven taking and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thoſe that are received unto Glory.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:159991:98"/>The Scripture ſetting out Heaven as a City: and fellowſhip with God as a Feaſt where Ieſus Chriſt comes as the Maſter of it, to ſee his Gueſts that they be welcome, and want nothing but every way entertained according to the State and Fulneſs and Riches of his Houſe: Such reading that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſets out Heaven as a Houſe, and as a Paradice for pleaſure, and as a Kingdome, that hath al kind of contentment in it and lives indepently: they hereupon begin to think of the ſtate of beleeving, as a participation of ſuch kind of things, and their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are taken much with them. And now mens apprehenſion of a ſtate of Grace and happineſs, it is formed up of theſe: They contemplate of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under theſe reſemblances. This is that which the Scripture cals the form of Knowledg. The form of Knowledg. As in a Map or Globe al the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and places of the World are put, that in one view they may be beheld. So men have in their minds, and head and thoughts what the Scripture hath thus ſet forth Heaven and Chriſt by, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then that their underſtanding goes not. Of this ſort of fanciful kind of Faith, are Raptures wherein men have viſions, and think they ſee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſights both walking and ſleeping, and that they hear voices ſpeaking unto them, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and calling them to that Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which they imagine the ſtate of Grace makes them Sharers in; imagining themſelves to be as upon thrones, and in Gardens, and in the midſt of pleaſures and treaſures. Theſe are the meaneſt and loweſt ſort of this kind, for thoſe that have but little or no underſtanding and inſight into the things of God, have theſe viſions and receptions in their minds and apprehenſions moſt frequently. Ignorant Perſons they know not the mind of God.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:159991:99"/>And many ſick dying men whoſe underſtandings are weakned, or who have but little underſtanding, all that is left them, being but a diſturbed fancy who have lived the life of man ſo far as underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and fancy goes, yet ſomtimes you ſhall find them ſpeaking of their deſires to be gone, to be in Heaven, to be gone to ſit upon Thrones, and going into arms, and going to be partakers of riches and greatneſs, and to be with their Savior, where Glory is prepared and many ſuch things. And yet it is but a Fancy, as is apparent if a man ſearcheth the bottom of it. They are taken with their appariſions and reſemblances of Glorious things, and in them they are ſafe. Metaphors or figurative ſpeeches (Let me ſpeak that by the way) are uſed by the Holy Ghoſt, and of uſe to ſignifie excellent things, and to win the mind to think of ſpiritual things: The mind is brought to think of thoſe Heavenly things by earthly things: Even as Children are won to drink off a cup of Phyſick by the gayneſs of the Cup, or ſome ſuch thing as takes the Fancy. But mark what I ſay. There are no Metaphors that can ſet out the things of Jeſus Chriſt, or Jeſus Chriſt, as they are to be received by Faith. No Metaphor can ſet them out. Saith the Text <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. <hi>No man knows the Father but the Son, and thoſe to whom he reveals him:</hi> And how doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal him? <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man:</hi> that is, Neither by the Eye, nor by the Ear, what God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love him. Therefore if you look into it you ſhal find an infinite diſproportion between the things figured, and the figure it ſelf. As for example. Chriſt is called Bread. Though this be an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbra</hi> and gives you a little ſhadow of Chriſt, yet it tels you not what Chriſt is: for bread doth but preſerve life, and Chriſt gives life unto
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:159991:99"/>them that have it not. And you know how bread is made: But Jeſus Chriſt is of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Mark it. So long as truths or things are in the Fancy, they are but little known. For they come not into the Fancy nakedly and in their own nature, but in ſome ſhapes, and figures, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations. Before the underſtanding can receive any thing it muſt ſubſtract the thing from all theſe figures and ſhapes which the fancy puts upon them.</p>
               <p>Yea indeed this kind of figurative apprehenſion, where it is alone, as it is the loweſt and meaneſt ſort of knowledg, ſo indeed it is nothing but a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual madneſs and diſtraction of mind. For as it is madneſs in a man that lies upon ſtraw to think himſelf upon a Throne, and for him that hath Chains about him, to count them the Enſigns and Badges of royalty and ſtate: And he that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to think himſelf to have al things. The like madneſs is it for a man to think of the glorious things of Jeſus Chriſt ſo meanly, as meat, and houſes, or any Metaphorical ſpeeches can ſet it forth to be. It is al one to think mean things glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and to count glorious things to be mean. At the beginning of the Reformation, the Devil hath been wonderful careful to dreſs up the fancies of men for Jeſus Chriſt. He hath appeared unto men that have been falling away from Popery under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhapes: And in al of them, as if he were an Angel of light, ſpeaking for and pleading for the Religion and worſhip of Chriſt, and ſetting out hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things according to earthly and carnal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. And poor Souls in thoſe times being deceived by him, have thought indeed that they had ſuch kind of Revelation as the Prophets of old, and have applied unto themſelves thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. <hi>That in the laſt daies young men
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:159991:100"/>ſhall ſee viſions, and dream Dreams, &amp;c.</hi> whereas all this while it hath been nothing elſe but a work of fancy, A figurative repreſentation of the things of Jeſus Chriſt unto them. Though there be a great deal of uſe to be made of figurative &amp; metaphorical ſpeeches in the Scripture yet they are neither able to ſet out Heavenly things to the ful, And as they are not able to ſet out Heavenly things to the ful, ſo the Ground of our Faith is not the ſimilitude that is between earthly things &amp; ſpiritual things, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the teſtimony which the word gives concerning Jeſus Chriſt. And mark this. If ſo be that we do receive the Teſtimony which the Scripture gives by Faith, then it is without any ſuch kind of ſhape or image in our Underſtandings, becauſe we do by Faith ſo know as God knows, As God knows intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, ſo doth Faith alſo.</p>
               <p>I ſay as Metaphors are not able to ſet out ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things ſpiritually: So that light by which they are to be received, is not that likeneſs which is between the ſimilitudes, but it muſt be from God himſelf immediately. Faith takes Gods teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It is not true Faith which judgeth, or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of any thing by any light, but the report of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>We have</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the mind of Chriſt.</hi> As God himſelf doth not know, his knowledg is not reſolved into or gotten by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors or ſimilitudes of earthly things, So neither is our knowledg that we have by Faith. There is a great oppoſition.</p>
               <p>There are two kinds of Arguments as differing as poſſibly can be.</p>
               <p>The receiving a thing upon report.</p>
               <p>And receiving things from ſimilitudes. That is another kind of reaſoning.</p>
               <p>As when we know there is a God, and infinite Wiſdom, and infinite goodneſs in that God we
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:159991:100"/>know it intuitively, (as they ſpeak) That is, there is ſomthing fals into the heart, which (without any image) doth fix this upon the heart, that there is ſuch a Wiſdom and Power. So from the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of God, there fals in ſuch light, as makes a man without any Image or figure to receive Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore I ſay you do but hold up Jeſus Chriſt in a Fancy, and hang him up as a picture in your houſe, and that is not a receiving him by Faith. Though this repreſentation of him is that which (as you ſhal hear hereafter) hath ſtrange effects upon men, <hi>viz.</hi> An Imaginary happineſs: And a perſwaſion raiſed upon a mans Imagination. A ſtrange kind of effect wrought upon mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the alteration of mens courſes.</p>
               <p>But there is a ſecond ſort, (that I may go on with that) of thoſe which have only Jeſus Chriſt in their Fancy, and they are thoſe that know and like of him only as he is a part of, and head, and main point of the Doctrine of Religion. As every ſcience doth conſiſt of divers principles and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon heads whereunto all other things are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. So doth Religion alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath put all that knowledg which is neceſſary unto ſalvation into a frame or model. The Scripture cals it a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of wholſome words, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. He hath put it into a Summary or Syſteme that we may ſee the Glory and excellency thereof at once, and be ſettled in it, and be taken with the apprehenſion of it, when we ſee one part agree with another: And there is no contradiction, and one depends upon and maintains the other. As in a building of a ſtately Houſe (which is uniform) when one part is a ſupport unto the other. Look into <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of foundations ſumming up al Religion into a few particulars. In 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. The Apoſtle ſaith that the pattern of wholſom
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:159991:101"/>words, or ſum of Religion, it doth conſiſt in Faith and love. And in another place he cals it the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is according unto godlineſs 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. Now in this model or frame, the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt is the principal point. Look upon the whol Scripture, and Jeſus Chriſt is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Theam. Look upon all the matters that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto ſalvation, and he is the chief Argument. Even as the Center is unto all the lines in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, So is Jeſus Chriſt unto all the ſeveral truths which belongs unto eternal life: They are all drawn from him, and they all tend unto him. And according unto this it is that men do receive Jeſus Chriſt. They receive him as a man receives the ſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or any other worthy that have done ſome noble Acts: That is, as he who is the ſubject about whom all that is conver ſant, And the Perſon by whom al thoſe great things have bin done. And this knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt is that which the Apoſte calleth a ſoundneſs in the Faith, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.2. when as men err not from, and make not ſhip-wrack, of Faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or Faith eſpecially. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. From this knowledg a man may be ſo eſtabliſhed in the profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt as that he may be able to inſtruct others, to anſwer all arguments that ſhall be brought againſt this profeſſion, and to endure much even as the Heathen Philoſophers that would rather die the cruelleſt death, than leave any one principle of their learning and profeſſion which they had received. So a man may ſee ſo great a reaſon for the things of Jeſus Chriſt, that a man ſhal not dare to part with the leaſt beam of it for the greateſt afflictions in the world, or to avoid the greateſt miſery. But yet notwithſtanding all this a man may be without ſaving Faith. It may be thus received into a mans mind and judgment, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:159991:101"/>yet not be a faith that wil bring him life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the laſt. For I beſeech you conſider it. A man may thus receive Jeſus Chriſt by a common gift of the ſpirit, though he hath no Grace. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20. The Apoſtle ſaith of thoſe that were not Jews in the Circumciſion of the heart, that they had a forme of knowledg and did delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Law, compared with the laſt verſe. And if you look into <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. You ſhal find that beſides the forme of Doctrine, unto a mans Salvation there is required his being delivered up unto it. But (ſaith he) you have obeyed from the heart the forme of Doctrine, whereunto you were delivered. DELIVERED, that is, caſt in the ſhape, and conformed unto it, ſo as that what you know, hath authority and power over you. As we ſay a man is delivered into ſuch a ones hand, when he is made ſure of, ſo as he cannot eſcape. A man muſt through obedience come under the power of that which he knows, or his knowledg is not ſaving.</p>
               <p>Yea notwithſtanding al this kind of knowledg, and this judgment, and underſtanding of Jeſus Chriſt, a man may have no affection nor love unto him at al. In <hi>John</hi> 2.25. It is ſaid that many beleeved upon Chriſt, but yet he ſaith, they were ſuch as he did not dare to truſt himſelf with al. That is, they would have betrayed him, and for their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage would have put him into the hands of his enemies. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>They have a form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but deny the power thereof in their lives.</hi> That is, a man may know much, and know it exactly, and yet the things known have no power to order their affection or to ſubdue their corruption. Or as ſome do underſtand the [Power] in oppoſition to the [Form.] They do not value the things as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:159991:102"/>they are in themſelves; Al their eſteem reacheth no further then the order and rank that theſe things beare in the matters of the world. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A man in caſting up an accompt may value a counter a pound, or a thouſand pound, only becauſe it is ſo in reckoning: So a man may value Jeſus Chriſt at a great reckoning, as one that contains al the doctrine that belongs unto Salvation, and yet notwithſtanding unto a mans ſelf Chriſt may be but a braſs Counter, and as one that hath no value in himſelf. That is al I ſhal leave concerning this point That Jeſus Chriſt is received only into the fancy, when a man knows not Chriſt in himſelf, but his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion is formed only into the Metaphors and figurative ſpeeches in the ſcripture of him. And when they know him only as he is the main point of Doctrine in religion, but his heart is not taken with himſelf.</p>
               <p>There are ſome who go yet further, And they are ſuch who take Jeſus Chriſt into their underſtanding But it is into the reaſoning part of them (as I may ſo ſpeak) that is, ſo far as they are convinced by demonſtrations and evidences and undenyable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo far they receive Jeſus Chriſt. True faith goes by teſtimony, and that is the argument and cheife ground of it. A man may receive the word of God to be true upon the ſame ground that he may receive any other writing, or book which teacheth a man, whether it be the knowledg of Countries, or of the hevens, or any other art whatſoever. In the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Iſay a man ſhal find the ſame things to perſwade him, which he finds in other books. A man beleeves other Books to be true, becauſe it hath good report, becauſe it is antient, And the parts agree, And they interfere not, nor contradict one another: They have experience that the things there ſaid, comes to paſs, &amp; the like things have been done which they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:159991:102"/>report. And ſo a man upon the antiquity of the ſcripture, and the agreement of the ſcripture, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the equity that is in the command of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, comes to think that the ſcriptures are true. But now the Spirit of God joyning with theſe, and ſitting upon theſe, (I ſay, Theſe common argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments withal ſciences) the ſpirit of God improving al theſe, may work upon men very much, But if ſo be that men go no further then theſe, there is not faith in Jeſus Chriſt neither. For I beſeech you mark it. Al faith, it is an act, ſo far as it is ſaving, it is a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling receiving of Jeſus Chriſt. But theſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations and arguments, they do compel the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The underſtanding cannot but conſent unto them, and it is irreſiſtibly (do what it can) bowed to give conſent according to the ſame, and that is an argument that it is not ſaving. As a man who yields obedience, not becauſe he loves the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, but becauſe he knows not how to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (or to do otherwiſe) being conquered. So theſe evidences and ſtrong reaſons, they leade a man captive, and a man conſents in his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing although the heart be againſt them: a man may joyn together with them, and yet notwithſtanding they be things which his heart doth moſt of al ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre: therefore they cannot be ſaving. Miſtake me not beloved.</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo carefull of having a good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as Faith is, It is the moſt ſecure Grace of truſting unto, that poſſibly can be: It will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is increated for its ground: It will either have a teſtimony from God that cannot err, or elſe it wil not receive.</p>
               <p>But though Faith may look after the cleereſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, yet it looks not after an evidence ariſing
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:159991:103"/>from the things themſelves, but from the word of God: Not from the Matter, but from Gods report. If God wil ſay it, let the thing be never ſo obſcure, and contrary to ſenſe or reaſon, yet Faith will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. But that which <hi>I</hi> now intend in this, is,</p>
               <p>That even as the Devils they do beleeve (the Text ſaith in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19.) but they do it, becauſe they have experience that the things which God hath ſpoken come to paſs (as I have ſhewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) They are convinced by what they have ſeen and found, that what they yet ſee not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, ſhal be in Gods own time. And ſo there is a Faith alſo among men, even concerning the things of the Goſpel, which is contrary unto their luſts: But yet its not grounded upon any thing, but meerly upon demonſtration, upon demonſtration (I ſay) or experience, and therefore it doth not ſave.</p>
               <p>There are ſome therfore that receive Jeſus Chriſt only into their reaſon. Into their reaſon only. I have made theſe ſeverall ſteps in the laying open of this truth, becauſe that the Devil doth with the Souls of men, even as Warriers do when they have a place to hold out againſt an enemy. If ſo be that they cannot keep one Wal, or one part of the Fort, they get to another, and there ſtrengthen themſelves: They would keep them out of al. If the Devil can keep Chriſt out of the fancies of men, he wil. If he cannot ſtay him there, by reaſon of the means that they live under, then he ſtaies him in Reaſon, and labors to ſet him up there: You ſhal know what I mean by it by and by.</p>
               <p>A man may receive Jeſus Chriſt into his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and yet have no good wil to him. (which is the Point that I have in hand) For as the Eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:159991:103"/>opened, cannot but ſee the light, ſo neither can the Underſtanding but take notice of the truth that is propounded unto it. The Will hath a power when the Object is before it to refuſe it, But the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding hath no ſuch power. But when as a thing is propounded, it cannot but obſerve it. A man may not like, nor own what is propounded, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take notice of it. And therefore (by the way) when we ſay that men will not know, or men are wilfully ignorant. The meaning is this, They wil not be known to know, or do wilfully keep themſelves from reflecting upon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what they do know: for when the light comes, It cannot (I ſay) but be received. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the better opening of a mans receiving Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt into his reaſon.</p>
               <p>Know, that there is a difference between Reaſon, and Reaſoning. In the Latine tongue, they have two words that do aptly expreſs it. <hi>Ratio</hi> and <hi>Rationis operatio.</hi> It is that reaſoning which God hath given unto men, to joyn truths together, which are of one ſort, and belongs unto one ſubject, And to collect and gather the conſequences which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereon. This is reaſoning. And by this many men come to be great diſputers, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (as you ſhal hear by and by) for that Faith of Chriſt which they have not dwelling in their hearts. As in the time of the Law, The Jews had ſome who kept their Genealogies, who retained the knowledg of every Tribe, the heads of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and the kindred, and the alliances which every one had to another by matches and marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. So God hath given [Reaſoning] in the ſoul this office, To keep the foundation, or principall heads of truths and to keep alſo in memory the conſequences, which are as it were the kindred of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:159991:104"/>thoſe foundation truths, the marriages which one common head hath with another, the influences which one point hath into another. This Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ads nothing unto truth, but doth ariſe from the nature of truth it ſelf, and is in the thing, in the truth, whether or no that it be reached by us or not. As for example.</p>
               <p>We reaſon thus. If God made the World, then the World was not eternall. Whether we collect this or not, yet in this ſaying, <hi>viz.</hi> That God made the World. This, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is not eternal is compriſed. And this kind of Reaſoning, the Scripture makes uſe of in the matters of Faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. Therefore we conclude that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt. And in <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Jeſus Chriſt proves the reſurrection of the bodies of men, <hi>viz.</hi> God hath ſaid; <hi>That he will be the God of</hi> Abraham, Iſaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and of thoſe that beleeve upon him. If he hath ſaid</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that he will be their God,</hi> then by conſequence, They do live unto him, and their bodies alſo ſhall live together with their Spirits. And becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh ſuch uſe of theſe conſequences, or this kind of reaſoning, therefore we are commanded to attend unto reading; becauſe the words of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are means whereby things comes thus into our Underſtanding. And we are required to Search the Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. which is a Metaphor taken from Hunters, whether they be Beaſts, or Men: They look after the foot-ſteps of their Game. As, by inſtinct the Dog taketh the ſent here and there, and follows the Game, as if it were following the concluſion. So the mind of a man puts things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and muſt put the things together that are in the Scripture, and conclude from them.</p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:159991:104"/>
               <p>But beſides this Reaſoning, There is alſo Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. which is the principles and notions of things that are in us by nature. And theſe are of two ſorts.</p>
               <p>Some are common and univerſally true. True in every Matter or Science. As for example. That the rule is before, and more known, than that which is ruled by it. That the Cauſe is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the Effect. That the means (ſo far as it is a means) is leſs excellent than the end. Theſe and divers others are true, not only in humane Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, but in matters of Faith. As for example. It is as true, that the ſcripture, becauſe it is a rule, is before mens Faith, and before the Church, and of greater authority and efficacy, Even as it is true, that the Laws of men are in order of nature before any thing can be done lawfully, or to have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or acceptation. And ſo again. The Body of Chriſt, though it be in Heaven and ful of Glory, yet notwithſtanding is as well contained there, and not every where, as it was in one place, and not in another when it was upon the earth.</p>
               <p>Now beſides thoſe generall and univerſal princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reaſon, there are in us by nature particular principles or notions which do belong unto parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſubjects. As, Unto the nature of God: and unto Righteouſneſs, and unto Juſtice: Whether that righteouſneſs be perſonall, and morall, or whether it be political, or that which a man is to exerciſe as a Iudg towards others. There are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are proper unto the beings and kinds of Creatures. Now to draw unto the thing that I would ſpeak unto in divers caſes.</p>
               <p>Both Reaſon &amp; reaſoning may argue an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo a want of true
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:159991:105"/>faith. The receiving Jeſus Chriſt may be ſuch both into reaſon, and into reaſoning as argues a man not to beleeve upon Chriſt unto the Salvation of his ſoul. Give me but leave to inſtance but in ſome of theſe as breifly as I can. As</p>
               <p n="1">I. When no more is beleeved concerning God and Jeſus Chriſt, (Mark it) when we beleeve no more of God and Jeſus Chriſt then can be deduced out of the principles of the knowledg of God, which are in us by nature. Take the principles of the knowledg of God which are in us by nature, and that not only in nature fallen and corrupted, but in perfect and innocent nature. The teſtimony which God gives us of himſelf through Jeſus Chriſt (I ſay that which God hath revealed Chriſt muſt do for us or elſe we cannot be ſaved) cannot be deduced from thoſe principles and from that reaſon, by any underſtanding whatſoever. Mark it. What God doth do in and by Jeſus Chriſt may be reduced unto that which God hath made known of himſelf, and is his nature: There is no inconſiſtency between them. Yea, the nature of God becomes a pawn and ſecurity for the making of that good. But out of the nature of God, theſe things cannot be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. As for example.</p>
               <p>There is no inconſiſtency between Gods holineſs, and his giving his Son for us. There is no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency between his Juſtice to puniſh ſin, and his pardoning of ſin, as he doth it: They may wel ſtand together. But the moſt perfect and abſolute underſtanding of the Juſtice, or of the holineſs of God, or of the mercy of God, cannot teach a man that God wil pardon, or that God wil give Jeſus Chriſt for him: But that a man muſt have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of from another relation. And that which
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:159991:105"/>(I ſuppoſe) doth make this as cleere as can be, is this; That the things which do belong unto our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Jeſus Chriſt, are acts of Gods meer wil and pleaſure: Such unto which his nature of it ſelf, acts not, but becauſe he of his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure wil ſo do. And therefore you ſhal find that the Goſpel is ſaid to be hid from the Angels, even the Angels that are in heaven, til it be revealed though that they have as perfect knowledg of God as Creatures can have. They ſee the face of my father continually, ſaith our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Angels that are in heaven, know the love of God, and they know the mercy of God, and they know the power of God: Theſe are the ſubjects of their meditation: They are indued with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that they can go as far, and pierce as deeply into them, as can be by creatures; And yet notwithſtanding, that God ſhould pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give a ſinner by Jeſus Chriſt, that they could not find out. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.13. That the Angels did ſtoop down: As a man lays his eare where he can hardly heare. So the Angels did ſtoop down. It was as much as they could do when God did reveal the Goſpel to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend or take notice of it. So you know that the ſcripture ſaith, that the things of Jeſus Chriſt they are (in <hi>Math.</hi> 16.17.) <hi>Not revealed by fleſh and blood, but by my father which is in Heaven,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. Were the matters of our Salvation the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary effects of Gods attributes, and his nature, then the things of our Salvation might be found out by thoſe that know and ſtudy that nature and thoſe Attributes. But that you ſee they cannot. The Prophets in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. That propheſied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt by an immediate revelation: yet were faint to have another revelation to know the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the time when the things whereof
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:159991:106"/>they ſpake ſhould be fulfilled and come to paſs. Take the divine nature of Chriſt as he is the ſecond perſon, of the ſame ſubſtance with the father, And though you ſhould know that fully, though you had a perfect underſtanding of it, yet could you not know by it, what the heart of Chriſt is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you as a Mediator. And the reaſon is, becauſe as what the father doth, he doth do voluntarily, and not from a neceſſity of nature: So what Jeſus Chriſt the ſon doth, he doth out of a voluntary compact and covenant made with the Father. And therefore he ſaith, he comes to do his wil. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.9. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He gave himſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto the wil of God and his Father.</hi> Now mark it. If ſo be that perfect nature, Man in innocency cannot underſtand by the nature of God what are the things which do belong unto Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt: If ſo be that a man muſt beleeve more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Salvation, then a perfect underſtanding (which the Angels have, if it were in man) can reveal unto him. Then muſt he beleeve more then the corrupt and depraved mind of man can teach him.</p>
               <p>Beloved, let me draw it down to a little more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſs that may fit your practiſe.</p>
               <p>The things which God hath revealed are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and judged by what is eſſential unto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God. It is lawful to examin what is the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial nature of God. It is lawful to look into what God wil do, that we may ſee his attributes ſhining forth in them: But to examin the truth of what he hath promiſed, by that which is eſſential and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral unto God, is for a man to go out of the way that is ſaving. I wil make it plain to you.</p>
               <p>You ſhal ſee many a poor ſoul, when he heares
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:159991:106"/>in the Miniſtry of the word cleerly aſſerted that God wil forgive and pardon ſin: The promiſes of life and Salvation are with ſuch evidence and light held forth, as that there is no exception can be made againſt them, Yet notwithſtanding you ſhal find a poor ſoul keeping off from reſting by faith in them, becauſe he ſaith God is Juſt and of a holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, And what communion can there be between ſuch a one as he is, and God? Mark it. Becauſe that the nature of God doth not of it ſelf give forth or promiſe ſo much as the Goſpel doth, therefore the Goſpel is called in queſtion by them. Who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou art when thou heareſt the promiſe of God in Chriſt and by Chriſt, that objecteth that God is juſt, and the avenger of ſuch a one as I am, Unleſs this be thy end, viz. To learne how the Juſtice of God is preſerved entire notwithſtanding he paſſeth thee by, unleſs it be I ſay to this end, Thou doſt lay a ſtumbling block before thy ſelf in the way of faith and beleeving: Yea thou doſt diſcover an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to beleeve upon Jeſus Chriſt. Thou thinkeſt God is unwilling to ſhew thee grace and mercy, becauſe thou thinkeſt he wil do no more then he muſt needs do by the neceſſity of his own nature. We count that man to be exceeding hard, who wil give no more then he is conſtrained to do by law. So thou doſt with God. Thou counteſt him to do no more then by law, if thou counteſt that he wil do nothing but what his nature doth hold forth: if thou makeſt his nature to be the rule, and not his promiſe.</p>
               <p>His nature doth give ſecurity that that which he hath promiſed ſhal be performed, and that he wil do what he hath promiſed. How hard is that man to beleeve, that wil beleeve no more then he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto? that wil beleeve no report unleſs he heares
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:159991:107"/>it with his own eares, and ſees it with his own eyes: And ſo doſt thou, when thou wilt not reſt in the promiſe of God. It is true indeed,</p>
               <p>That men may be brought to beleeve, we teach them that the nature of God is good and kind and merciful: But it is only to theſe ends, and in this ſenſe: Partly to ſhew them that God is not moved by any thing out of himſelf: But not to ſhew them that he were not God by nature unleſs he took their cauſe to heart. And partly it is to ſhew them how his wil hath ſet his nature on work for them, and of his grace he hath laid a law upon himſelf that as he is holy, he ſhould keep his word, And as he would be acknowledged to be powerful, ſo he ſhould work for us: and as he would have the glory of his Juſtice, ſo he ſhould ſave. And therefore Chriſt uſeth theſe titles, <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Holy Father,</hi> as it is in <hi>John.</hi> 17.11.21. But this is the firſt thing. When men wil beleeve no more then can be deduced out of thoſe principles which they have of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of God in them by nature, when as the things that God hath promiſed by Joſus Chriſt, are thoſe things which his nature wil make good, but they are thoſe things only which his wil hath given to us.</p>
               <p n="2">II. And again, Men do receive Jeſus Chriſt into their reaſon only, when as they wil beleeve no more then can be demonſtrated, and evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the ſcriptures themſelves. Concluded from the ſcripture, every thing muſt be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively or by juſt conſequence, and it is beleeved ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly: But though it muſt be concluded juſtly, yet it is not neceſſary that it ſhould be demonſtrative unto our faith. A concluſion is then demonſtrative (mark it) when it is as clear and evident as the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:159991:107"/>principle is whence it is drawn. I ſay when it is as cleer. As for example. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. Saith the Apoſtle, If Chriſt died for al, then were al dead. This is the concluſion, Then were al dead: and this is as demonſtrative and as cleer as this, That Chriſt died. For he died for them, and in their ſtead: and he needed not to die for them and in their ſtead, if they had not been lyable to death themſelves. But al matters of faith, al matters that ſhal be done for us by Jeſus Chriſt, ſhal not be thus cleerly demonſtrated. That is the thing in hand. For the proofe of it. Conſider with your ſelves, that it is the ſelf ſame faith whereby a man doth beleeve his own Salvation, and doth beleeve the truth of the promiſes. The faith of aſſurance it is a divine faith, as wel as the faith of aſſent is unto what God hath revealed. A man that makes this diſcourſe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that doth beleeve ſhal be ſaved,</hi> takes that upon the word of God, which cannot be denyed: But I have true faith, faith he and therefore I ſhal be ſaved. This concluſion now is as divine, becauſe drawn from that propoſition, as that propoſition is, That he that beleeves ſhal be ſaved: But it is not as demonſtrative and cleere. It is as true I ſay but not as cleere. Then you ſee that more is to be beleeved then can be cleerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. The ſcriptures are like a treaſure or womb, which containe more things in them then the word at the firſt face and looking upon can make known unto the mind of a man. I would but only inſtance in one thing more, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.32. which I ſpake of juſt now. Chriſt goes about to prove the reſurrection of the dead from this, that God ſaid, he wil be the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> That he wil be their God: that is cleere. From thence he concludes therefore that the dead ſhal riſe: This is as certaine, but it is not ſo cleere,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:159991:108"/>unleſs God firſt explains what it is to be a God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one. It is required of Faith in this promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> to expect as much as God can do for one, though it be not expreſſed. That is the thing that I aim at. Matters of favors are to be alwaies inlarged: and promiſes are to be interpreted in the extenſiveſt and largeſt ſenſe. And you have this proof of it, becauſe when God ſaith, he will be ones God, and gives him this promiſe, he is bound to beleeve that God will do as much for him as he can, though thoſe words do not expreſs it, Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith Chriſt in <hi>Math.</hi> 22.29. <hi>You err not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the Scripture, and the power of God.</hi> You think the Scriptures contain no more in them than what the words do at firſt ſight, and in their view tender to you. You muſt (ſaith he) interpret the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture according to Gods power, and know, where he hath ſaid he will be a God unto a man, there he hath ingaged all his power to do for a man, or elſe you err. You err not knowing the Scripture, and the power of God.</p>
               <p>However the words of ſcripture are uſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and limit the ſenſe of our Faith, or the hope of our Faith, yet they are not given to limit and bound the goodneſs of God. The goodneſs of God and the love which he bears, and the good that he will do, is far greater (becauſe it is infinite) than words taken from men can ſet forth.</p>
               <p>There are ſome that go yet further in their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Jeſus Chriſt, and they put him into their affections. They that hold that mans Will muſt have the caſting voice in the matters of his converſion and ſalvation, uſe this diſtinction.</p>
               <p>They fay, the Will may be wrought upon <hi>quo
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:159991:108"/>ad affectum,</hi> but not <hi>quo ad effectum.</hi> God by means doth effect the Will, But that the Wil ſhould be throughly effected and brought over unto the things that God would have it, that ariſeth from a mans own ſelf. The diſtinction is good and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the point in hand, though it be applied by them. But it hath this truth in it. That a man may have his affections ſtirred, and ſtirred under the means with the things which do belong unto eternal life, and yet notwithſtanding have his heart ful of luſts, and his wil ſtand in the ſame firmneſs, ſtiffneſs, and ſtubborneſs againſt the things of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as if he had no ſuch kind of affections. Let me but inſtance in this one particular.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a man to be taken or delighted with a Jewel that is worth millions, but the delight that he hath in it, is but as the delight which belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a thing worth but twenty pounds. So there may be a delight in Jeſus Chriſt, but not ſuitable to the worth and excellencies of him. Suppoſe yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Suppoſe a man ſhould make ſhew of love unto a man (as I ſaid in the beginning of the point) but yet ſhould lodg him among vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom he loaths, no man will ſay, this mans affections are good. So when as Jeſus Chriſt ſhal be lodged with the Devil, and with thy luſts and corruptions, With one breath thou art for him, and with another thou art for them, When thy ſins reign and live in thy heart, taking their pleaſures, and rouling themſelves with delight and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet thou ſaieſt there is none like unto, and none can ſave but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: A man may be affected that hath ſins reigning in him (that is out of controverſie) with the things of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20. They received the word with joy, who loved the world, better than
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:159991:109"/>the word, and therefore when tribulation aroſe, they parted with the word, and fell unto the world preſently. I beſeech you beloved know thus much. That as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when he was to keep the Paſſeover,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark</hi> 14.15.</note> bid his Diſciples go and they ſhould find a man, and they ſhould ask for an upper room, and there he would eat the Paſſeover. The Upper rooms among the Jews were their Gueſt-chambers, which were far from their lower rooms whereinto ordinary Perſons came: Ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were below, but they were with their friends in the Upper room. Know thus much, That when Jeſus Chriſt comes into the ſoul by Faith, he will have an upper room, the beſt of your Underſtanding and Will: He wil not be thruſt into a room with Satan and with your luſts, and with dirt: he will not be corrival with them in one houſe. In a word beloved. If there be any Perſon that you have a reſpect unto, if there be any good thing that you have a reſpect unto, and ſubject it not unto him: If there be any evill that you have reſpect unto, he wil not have reſpect unto you. That is certain. That Faith ſhal go for nothing that can lay hold upon Jeſus Chriſt, and yet ſcrable after the world, and this and that luſt, as if there were good and happineſs to be found in it. This particular point that I am upon, To beleeve upon conviction, hath ſome difficulty in it, and I would fain make it plain to you, it is not your conviction that is the reaſon that your Faith is good (Mark it) But it is a ſign your Faith is not good, when you wil beleeve nothing but what you have convictions of, from the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For the Spirit of God working in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate man, he doth but improve things that are common: His nature is not changed, and therefore uſeth but ordinary and humane abilities to the beſt improvement of them.</p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:159991:109"/>
               <p>But all that I aim at in all that I have ſaid, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but this. That in this great matter of your Faith, you would look warily to your ſelves that you be not deceived. Take heed leaſt when you think you have received Chriſt into your heart, you have indeed carried him only into the outward room thereof, and not given him the chief place. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men can diſpute for Chriſt, and many men they are ſtout, and of courage in the Doctrine of Chriſt, and yet notwithſtanding for all this they have not the ſaving Faith of him. Many men there are that that becauſe they think to compound all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to make a way eaſie to their beleeving by proceeding in the matters of Faith by the wiſdome of men, they loſe their own Souls. How many men are there that judg themſelves, that becauſe they cannot ſo mourn for ſin, as they mourn for Children, and they cannot be ſo carried after Chriſt, as they are after the things they love here: Be it Husband, or Wife, or the like, therefore they think they have no love at all. This is only to make the things of the Goſpel ſubject to the Laws and principles of reaſon. It's true indeed, there is greater reaſon why you ſhould love God more than Children, And the leaſt diſcovery of him, more than comfort: That is, there is a ground why you ſhould do ſo: Yet know that your love is not judged by what you do to theſe things which are altogether in your power, But by what carriage and affection you bear unto God, who is contrary unto you by nature, but yet brought near by Jeſus Chriſt. And it is a greater matter to a poor Soul (though it cannot do what it ſhould do) to love God a little, when it hath ſo much corruption to plead with him for to get his heart from God, than it is for a man to love a Child ſo affectionately, when there is nothing in his heart to draw him from

Saith God. <hi>My thoughts are not as your thoughts, nor my waies as your waies.</hi> The waies of men are, that if they do good, they ſhall receive good: But Gods way is, to juſtifie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and to do good againſt evill. You think ſaith he, that if you buy you muſt have money, or moneys worth, But know (ſaith God) that my bargains are not driven on as yours are.

This is a riddle, That a man may buy without money, or monies worth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all kind of bargainings are by one of them. But Gods waies are not as your waies. It is enough for you that you have the word of God: He knows what is beſt for his own Glory, Therefore take his word, And do not judg of things according to what thy reaſon doth ſuggeſt, and ſquare not thy hopes according to thy ſenſe, and as thy wiſdome directs, for he knows what is the beſt way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his mercy by.</p>

               <p>Its the duty of all; for upon one mans ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto Chriſt about his inheritance, he turns his ſpeech unto all. <hi>He ſaid unto them.</hi> That is, to al the Company at the thirteenth verſe. And it is a duty as they would attain to eternal life: for to that end Jeſus Chriſt bids them to beware of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs that they might not die as a Pool doth, as you have it in verſe, 20. Mens inordinate deſires after the lawful things of this life, do as well hinder them from Heaven, as if they were ſinfull things, or groſs prophaneſs, for in the following verſes of this Chapter, you have the Anatomizing of a man that was dead and gone to Hell, for he died like a Fool: And it ſheweth the Diſeaſe and Cauſe of the miſery, he was found not to live in any groſs ſin, but only in this, that he was Covetous.

               <p n="1">I. What Covetouſneſs is, for the great difficulty of the Point lies in the explication of what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is, which may be taken two waies:</p>
               <p>Either as it is a general,</p>
               <p>Or as it is a ſpecial ſin.</p>
               <p>In generall, or as it is a general ſin, and ſo it goes in a double Notion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt: It is a minding of Earthly things, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. It's taken in generall for that evil frame of heart, whereby a man when he hath once ſinned, deſires to commit the ſame, or another. And ſo it is taken in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>For the Iniquity of his Covetouſneſs was I wrath, and I did hide my ſelf.</hi> The Hebrew word ſignifies any kind of deſire whatſoever, Not only after Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as Covetouſneſs is, but after any thing that is unlawfull. And it's probable, yea more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Holy Ghoſt doth ſo take it, becauſe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:159991:112"/>he ſaith they did go on in the way of their own heart, that is, they did what they liſted, the more they ſinned, the more they had a mind to ſin. And the Apoſtle in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. ſaith concerning ſome men, that they did commit all ſin with greedineſs: In the Greek, it is with <hi>Covetouſneſs;</hi> the Apoſtle there only ſpeaks concerning the boundleſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite that is in men to do as much as they can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. The groſſeſt ſins that are contentfull and pleaſurable are gainfull to them: ſo that in the Scripture Covetouſneſs ſomtimes ſignifies that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of men to commit ſin, after they have once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it, and are left by God to take pleaſure and contentment in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly: As it's a general ſin in that ſenſe, ſo alſo as it is an uncontentedneſs with a mans out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition. I ſay it is an uncontentedneſs, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. it's ſaid. <hi>Let your Converſation be without Covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as you have.</hi> Uncontentedneſs is leſs than diſcontent. For he is uncontented, who is not well pleaſed, But he is diſcontented who frets, murmurs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, that thinks much of Gods diſtributions, and that envies another that hath more than himſelf. So you have it laid down in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 37.1. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of the wicked:</hi> And by the Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi> in Chap. 8. verſe 21. where he brings in men which cannot have that liberty from their Enemies which they deſire, They do rage againſt God, <hi>They do curſe their Ring and their God and look upwards.</hi> As a Dropſie is a thirſt which is not to be quenched: Drink, and you are ſtill dry: So there is an evill frame of heart in men to be unſatisfied with any thing that God doth for them, and that is called Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs: Becauſe that Covetouſneſs is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedneſs with a mans outward Condition, or
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:159991:113"/>a deſire of more, therefore it's a breach of all the Commandments of the ſecond Table by which mens outward Conditions are ordered. As it is wel obſerved, that as the firſt Commandment hath an influence into all the Commandments of the firſt Table, The Love of God, being the Sum of that: So the laſt Commandment which forbids to Covet, hath an influence into all the Duties of the ſecond Table. As for example. In 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth there call Adultery or mens luſting after their Neighbors Wives, Covetouſneſs, when a man Commits Adultery, he is there ſaid to be Covetous. <hi>Let no man go beyond or defraud his Brother</hi> [De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud] But the word in Greek, is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Covet,</hi> to be covetous. You have it in the Text, <hi>In any matter,</hi> but in the Grek it is, <hi>In this matter:</hi> And which makes it appear that he ſpeaks only concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chaſtity, and uncleanneſs, for verſe 7. (ſaith he) <hi>God hath not called us unto uncleanneſs, but unto Holineſs.</hi> In the eighth Commandment, Covetouſneſs is a breach of that liberality and bounty which men ſhould ſhew unto all men, but eſpecially unto the Saints. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5. the Apoſtle bids them that they ſhould not give out of Covetouſneſs, but out of bounty: So that the ſeventh and the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and by the ſame reaſon all the reſt of the Commandments of the ſecond Table are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when as a man is not content in his preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And it's a breach in Terms, for, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Covet thy Neighbors Wife, nor his Servant, nor his Maid, nor his Ox, nor his Aſſe, nor any thing that is his.</hi> Therefore Covetouſneſs is ſaid to be a breach of them, becauſe it makes a man that he doth not quiet himſelf in that ſtate wherein God hath put or placed him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and Laſtly: Covetouſneſs is an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs in a mans outward condition, though he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:159991:113"/>would only by lawful meanes increaſe or better it. Lawful means muſt be uſed, and a bleſſing prayed for upon them, but a man muſt uſe lawful means lawfully, and be content though God doth not give in ſucceſs, elſe he is Covetous. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that is, becauſe Covetouſneſs doth lye in a mans uncontentedneſs or diſcontentedneſs with his preſent Condition. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. verſ. 5. <hi>Let your Converſation be without Covetouſneſs and be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch things as you have.</hi> Covetouſneſs lyes in uncontentedneſs or diſcontentedneſs. The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of means doth not take away the ſin, but rather increaſe it: becauſe lawful means are then abuſed when they are uſed to ſatisfy mens luſts from diſcontent with Gods Providence. And if you look into this place, the way that this man took was a lawful way. It was not by any other courſe that he would get his own than by referring the matter to another, <hi>Maſter</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Speak unto my Brother that he divide the inheritance with me,</hi> and yet Chriſt accuſeth him of Covetouſneſs, becauſe he did ſee in him a want of Subjection to the wil of God. To make it more cleer that a man may be Covetous in the uſe of lawful meanes to better his eſtate and Condition, conſider but the meaning of the tenth Commandment, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Covet.</hi> The meaning is this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet thy neighbors Wife</hi> in a lawful way (though thou wouldeſt not have her but in a lawful way) but be pleaſed with thy own. And thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbors oxe, though thou wouldeſt not have it but for thy money: for al unlawful ways of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving another mans oxe were forbidden in the eighth Commandement. To deſire another mans wife or any thing that is his wrong and injury, is forbidden in the ſeventh and eight Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, The tenth Commandment is therefore a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:159991:114"/>ſuppreſſion of mens deſires in lawful ways after that which they have not. And unto this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment was the ſin of <hi>Ahab</hi> to be referred who did mourne and greive becauſe he had not <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard upon the price and the value of it. <hi>Ahab</hi> was puniſhed for his Covetouſneſs, and yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired nothing but only to have <hi>Naboths</hi> vinyard for a price, or upon Exchange, which are lawful ways of bargaining. And it appeares evidently that that is the meaning of the tenth Commandment, <hi>(Thou ſhalt not Covet)</hi> is to make men content with that they have, although they might by lawful means, have that which is anothers, becauſe the deſires by unlawful meanes are forbidden in the reſt of the Commandments, The deſire of another mans Wife in an unlawful way is forbidden in the ſeventh Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> And the deſire of another mans eſtate in an unlawful way is forbidden in the eighth Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Steal,</hi> As was hinted before. Seeing therefore there is a deſire in this forbidding, which is not forbidden in the reſt. It muſt be a deſire which is in men to the things of another, though it be by lawful means. As I ſaid before ſo I ſay now, that Lawful means may be uſed to advance a mans eſtate, and a bleſſing upon the uſe of thoſe means may be begged, but a man muſt be contented with the will of God whither he bleſſeth, or bleſſeth not elſe he is Covetous. And thus I have ſpoken of Covetouſneſs as its a General Sin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, But now you may conſider Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Strictly or ſpecially as it is a ſpecial ſin, And ſo I deſcribe it thus. Covetouſneſs is an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs, or a deſire of having much, ariſing from an uncontentedneſs with a mans condition. It is an uncontentedneſs with or a deſire of having a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bundance,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:159991:114"/>out of a diſcontentedneſs with a mans preſent eſtate, though he might by lawful means mend or better it: and ſo you have it almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in the words of the Text, for when Chriſt had ſaid. <hi>Beware of Covetouſneſs</hi> he adds by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>A mans life conſiſts not in the abundance of that which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> That therefore which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this life, and the ſeeking of it in abundance, is Covetouſneſs. The object of Covetouſneſs is riches or abundance of the things that do belong to this life. A man may not care for mony and yet be Covetous, becauſe mony doth but ſerve his deſire after other things. And therefore when you find that the ſcriptute ſpeaks of Covetouſneſs as a deſire of mony, as it is 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 6.10. <hi>That the love of mony is the root of al evil,</hi> the reaſon is not becauſe Covetouſneſs lyes in the deſire of mony only, but becauſe <hi>mony anſwers al things.</hi> Men are therefore Covetous, becauſe by loving of mony they are in love with any thing that may be gotten by it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Having Food and Rayment they ſhould be there with contented</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Covetouſneſs lyes as much in the deſire of Cloathes, and meat, as of mony.</p>
               <p>I call it a deſire. For ſo the Scripture doth in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. When it ſpeaks of the luſt of the eye. But every luſt or deſire after riches is not unlawful, or Covetouſneſs (becauſe riches is made by God to be of uſe, and to be inſtruments to many good and pious uſes) but only that luſt or deſire which ariſeth from diſcontent or from unconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs rather. Therefore it is that the ſcripture when ever it ſpeaks of Covetouſneſs, doth joyn diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedneſs with it. And that uncontentedneſs may be diſcovered as wel by a mans actions, as any thing elſe. For as when a man goes about to do thoſe things which cannot be done by any ordinary
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:159991:115"/>power, he tempts God, and cals in Satan to come to his aſſiſtance: So when a man doth thoſe things which are incompatible with his ſtate, he doth in that deſire more than God hath given him at the preſent. There is as well a prayer in actions, as in deſires or any other way.</p>
               <p>A man may be ſaid to have a deſire after much or abundance two waies.</p>
               <p>Either whenas he deſires to have that which he hath not, and in that reſpect it may be a poor mans ſin, as well as the rich.</p>
               <p>Or elſe when a man is content with that which he hath, but is not willing to lay it forth as God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns him: when he would have that whereof he is poſſeſſed, and not part with it, or lay it out to ſuch uſes which God aſſigns him. Mark it: Though a man counts he hath enough and deſires no more, yet if he be not willing to part with that which he hath, when God commands him, he is Covetous. In <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.2. ſaith he, <hi>I have ſeen this evill under the Sun that God hath given to a man riches, that he wants nothing, and yet God gives him not power to eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> This is an evil Diſeaſe. You may be covetous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you wil not give forth of that which you have. In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18. The Apoſtle oppoſeth unto Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs Diſtribution unto thoſe that are in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: He exhorts rich men that they would (as a fruit of their truſting in the Lord) <hi>Be ready to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</hi> When men are not ready, they are then the Servants of the World, becauſe they have not a heart to diſpoſe of the world, but are diſpoſed and ordered by it.</p>
               <p>And let me take in that which I ſaid in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral explication of it, and that is this, That it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ariſing from uncontent, or diſcontent, though that a man may by Lawful means get more. That a man may be covetous in the uſe of lawful means to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:159991:115"/>increaſe his Eſtate, or though he do but deſire by lawful means to have his Eſtate increaſed: A man may be covetous in the uſe of a lawfull Calling. It is true indeed that Covetouſneſs is in the Scripture ſet forth by the unlawfull waies that men take to get riches: So the Apoſtle ſaith concerning the Miniſters in 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.11. that did preach ſtrange things for filthy lucre's ſake. And as it's ſaid, they do make haſt to be rich, and they do oppreſs their Brethren, and defraud: But preaching ſtrange things and oppreſſion, and defrauding are rather effects, than formal Acts of Covetouſneſs. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs may bring ſome men to thoſe Acts, but a man may be covetous that uſeth none of them; And the Reaſon is apparent, becauſe Covetouſneſs lies in a diſcontentedneſs, diſ-ſatisfaction, or unconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs of mind with Gods portion, or taking care for a man. I wil not hold you longer here, becauſe I ſhall ſpeak in the uſe of tryal and Examination of the nature of Covetouſneſs.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>SEcondly: And therefore in the ſecond place, Conſider the Reaſons why you ought to take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs. In <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.3. ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Let not Covetouſneſs be once named among you as becometh Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let it not be once named.</hi> That is, Let it be unknown, unpractiſed, as thoſe things we are moſt ignorant of, which we know not the name of. Let it be abominable to you, for you know they would not have the name of thoſe things in their mouths, which were an abomination, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. ver. 4. And unleſs it be thus, ſaith he, you carry not your ſelves as becomes Religion. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. ſaith he, <hi>Let your Converſation be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Covetouſneſs. [Covetouſneſs]</hi> your whol courſe of life, in every turning and winding of it, whether you be young or old, whether you be ſingle or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried perſons: In whatever caſe you be, ſaith he, yet be not covetous. They were in troubles, yet
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:159991:116"/>it was a great deal worſe for them to be in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, than to be in wants. They wanted all things, for they were ſcattered up and down like Chaff before the Wind, but yet then God would not allow them to be diſcontented with their Eſtate and Condition, but to count that beſt wherein they were. The word is well tranſlated, <hi>Be without Covetouſneſs.</hi> But it ſignifies, be without the love of Money or Silver. And I ſay it's well tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>be without Covetouſneſs,</hi> becauſe as money doth anſwer unto all things, ſo in the forbidding of a man to deſire Money, he forbids him to deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which God hath not yet given him: But be content with that which you have. They might ſay that that which they have is leſs than nothing, it's worſe than nothing, yet be contented: We live among a People whoſe Language we know not; we have loſt the Eſtate to which we are born; yet be contented: We know not when it wil be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, yet be contented: That which is your preſent ſtate you muſt make the beſt of, but be not unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And there is a great deal of reaſon for this, if you conſider theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. The greatneſs of the ſin,</item>

               <p>
                  <hi>REASON I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt: It is a ſpirituall ſin. A ſpirituall ſin (as the Schools expreſſe it) is ſuch as may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, though there be no external or outward
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:159991:117"/>Act done. It's ſuch a ſin as a man may commit, though he breaks not forth into any externall Act, or Act of injuſtice. It's a heart ſin, that is bred and born there. In <hi>Math.</hi> 15.19. <hi>From the heart comes Covetouſneſs.</hi> It's a ſin that is purely ſpirituall, as Unbelief is, for it lies in an inordinateneſs of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Luſt. As the ſins of the Devils are <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Wickedneſs.</hi> They are ſet forth by this in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. That they are ſpirituall wickedneſs, becauſe they do not only ariſe from Malice againſt God, from an inward oppoſition to his Holineſs and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but becauſe they are ſo done by themſelves, as the Acts only of the underſtanding and the Wil are in us. There may be an Act of the Underſtanding, and an Act of the Will (ſuppoſe it be an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or hatred of God) and yet there not be an ill word ſpoken, or a groſs outward ſin committed: So ſuch a ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Covetouſneſs; This ſets forth the ſinfulneſs of Covetouſneſs, that it's a ſpirituall wickedneſs, It's bred in the Heart, it comes from thence, and it lives there. The more there is of the heart in a ſin, the greater the ſin is: I ſay the more ſinfulneſs there is in any ſin, the more there is of the heart in it. Therefore Originall Corruption is greater than actuall ſins: Now Covetouſneſs doth take up the heart, As I ſhall ſhew you more by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>REASON II.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly: The greatneſs of this ſin appears in this, that it is a ſin that doth over-ſpread the whol man: It reſts not in any one part or faculty of the Soul, but it doth over-ſpread the whole, and that not only by infuſion, but by formall in-dwelling. That is, Not only doth it work upon the Soul, but the whol Soul is the ſeat of it. And therefore you
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:159991:117"/>ſhall ſometimes find that it is deſcribed by the mind, that it over-ſpreads the underſtanding. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Phillip.</hi> 3.19. they are ſaid to mind Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. And ſometimes by the Wil, that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreads the wil, in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. Men are ſaid ſo to love the World, as that they cannot love God himſelf. <hi>If any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> As Appetite and deſire is in every part of a man. There is no part of a man, but hath an appetite and deſire in it to its own Object, So in no part of the Soul, but alſo may be diſcontent, which is Covetouſneſs. So that its a ſin which infects from the Crown of the Head to the Sole of the Foot, and there is no part free. Of al the Graces that God hath beſtowed upon men, there are but two that are principally obſerved to be diffuſed through the the whole Soul. And they are, Faith, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And therefore they are the moſt excellent Graces, becauſe they have the greateſt command. Of all ſins, there is none that have more of the old Man, than Covetouſneſs hath, becauſe it hath not only the affective part (the Wil) but the Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative part, (the Underſtanding.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>REASON III.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly: Covetouſneſs appears to be a very great ſin, and very ſinful in this; that it's directly oppoſite unto the common nature of Godlineſs and Religion. Some Vices are oppoſite to one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Vertue: But Covetouſneſs is oppoſite unto all in it's common nature: And therefore hath the greateſt contrariety in it; for this is the common nature of all Religion, to be Heavenly and Holy. And this is the Aſpect or conſideration of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, to make a man Earthly. Therefore it's ſaid by God himſelf, in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. That <hi>if a man
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:159991:118"/>loves the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> It might have been truly ſaid, that if a man love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſin, he loves not God, but God will rather put that note upon the love of the World, rather than upon any thing. The Character is put upon Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, becauſe its the moſt diametrically oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto Grace of any ſin. To open this a little. Thoſe things differ moſt, which differ in kind. As there is therefore an infinite and unconceivable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (and one that cannot be made up) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us, becauſe he is of himſelf, and we are Creatures. It's impoſſible that ever we ſhould come to be Gods, or God to become what we are, becauſe God and we are not of the ſame kind: He is of himſelf, and we are of him. More plainly: There is a greater difference you know between Gold and the Heavens, than there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gold and the Earth, becauſe Gold is but a refined part of the Earth, but the Heavens are of another kind of Being and Creation. Things which differ in their kind, differ moſt. But now the very kind of Religion and Covetouſneſs differs. For what is Religion but a Heavenly and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thing? And what is Grace but a ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that comes down from above, but Covetouſneſs faſtens a mans Soul to earthly and baſe things. And upon this ground it is called Idolatry in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Covetouſneſs which is Idolatry.</hi> It's called ſo upon this ground, becauſe as the fear and love and honor of God is the Ground of all obedience, ſo the taking of the things of this life into our choice, eſteem, and care, is the putting out, and the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, and eradicating of all ſervice unto God: That a man doth take for his God, which he choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth before all other things. When therefore a mans heart is ſo ſet that he muſt have riches and the things of this life, he ſets up that for his God,

               <p>
                  <hi>REASON IV.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly: The ſinfulneſs of it appears in this: That it is the Womb and Seed of all ſin. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.16. you have it as one of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, or Commanders of all the ſins in the world. All ſins are ſummed up either into <hi>The Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> that is, Luxury and pleaſure; <hi>The Luſts of the Eye,</hi> that is, Worldlineſs or Riches; Or <hi>the Pride of life,</hi> that is, Honor. In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. <hi>The love of Money is the root of al Evill. The root,</hi> partly becauſe the Devil doth ingraft every ſin upon that as the ſtock of it, and partly becauſe it doth vertually contain al ſin in it. From thence <hi>Cain</hi> murders, <hi>Judas</hi> betraies Chriſt, <hi>Achan</hi> ſteals the Babiloniſh Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Demas</hi> Apoſtatizeth from Religion: <hi>Demas</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>hath forſaken us, and cleaves unto this preſent World.</hi> in 2 Tim. 4.10. Therefore you ſhal find what the Companions of Covetouſneſs are in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Being filled with all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, Fornication, Wickedneſs, Covetouſneſs, Maliciouſneſs, full of Envy, Murder, &amp;c.</hi> And that you may not think it was the ſingular caſe of the corrupt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, you ſhall obſerve that wherever the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Covetouſnes, he ſpeaks of it as being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with thoſe ſins. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man be called a Brother who is a Fornicator, a Drunkard, Covetous, an Idolator, &amp;c.</hi> In 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. <hi>Among Fornicators, Idolaters, effeminate perſons, and Theeves, there are Covetous perſons and Drunkards reckoned up.</hi> In <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, inordinate affections, evill Concupiſcence, Covetouſneſs which is Idolatry.</hi> And that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle may not ſeem to be in a heat or paſſion, when he doth thus deſcribe the Companions of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:159991:119"/>you ſhall find that in <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.22. our Lord himſelf ſaith as much, <hi>From the hearts of men ariſe Theft, Adultery and Covetouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> And it's worth obſervation, That when the Evangeliſt <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> doth repeat thoſe words, he leaves out Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs: But when <hi>Mark</hi> came to add unto that which <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote (which was the manner of the Evangeliſts to add unto others) he puts in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs: Becauſe whoever is Covetous hath the root of all theſe in him, and not becauſe whoever is Covetous doth all theſe things. You ſhall find therefore in the Scripture that the way which Satan takes to deſtroy men is expreſly ſet out by this of Covetouſneſs. In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Devices of Satan; And he ſets forth the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Satan in the beginning of the verſe, <hi>that he makes advantage of us.</hi> Now that word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he will do with us, as one that is Covetous. The meaning is this, Look as a Covetous man doth deſire to be poſſeſſed of that which he hath not, ſo doth the Devil lie at the Catch that he may ſeiz upon any ſpirit. That which I bring it for is this, That the Holy Ghoſt ſets out al the devices and evill waies of Satan, by this name of Coveting. Becauſe a man is as pat to ſin, as the Devill is to tempt: And a man is made as covetous by ſinning, as the Devil is in his unſatisfied ſpirit. So the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſin appears in this that it is the root of all ſin, and becauſe of that, it is the Cauſe of all ſin. It's a ſin that never goes alone but ingenders many others. In whatever perſon it is, it doth ſo. If Covetouſneſs fals upon Soldiers, then in <hi>Luke.</hi> 3.14. <hi>When they are not content with their wages, they do violence, and accuſe falſly.</hi> If Covetouſneſs fals upon a Magiſtrate, it makes him that he is partiall by Covetouſneſs. And therefore the mark of a good Magiſtrate is, <hi>That he muſt fear God and have
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:159991:119"/>Covetouſneſs.</hi> Becauſe Bribes blind the Eyes, the Judgment. If Covetouſneſs fals upon Miniſters, it will in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. <hi>make them fall into perverſe diſputings, for they ſuppoſe that Gain is Godlineſs.</hi> If it fals upon an ordinary Chriſtian, there you ſhal find that it goes not alone neither, for in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22. together with the deceitfulneſs of riches, there goes the Cares (as the Text ſaith) of this life. <hi>He that received ſeed among the thornes, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world and the deceitfulneſs of riches, choak the word, and he becometh unfruitfull.</hi> In <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14. there is another ſin ariſeth from it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides unfruitfulneſs, and that is that men take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the things of this life. <hi>That which fel among thorns, are they which when they have heard, go forth and are choaked with Cares and Riches, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this life.</hi> And that you may ſee how ſtrong a vertue there is in Covetouſneſs to bring forth theſe ſins, mark the Text. <hi>When they have heard the word, they go forth,</hi> that is all the reaſon why the word of God and all the allurements of the word of God are not able to ſtay the heart from theſe Courſes. A Sin may be ſaid to bring forth, or to be the cauſe of ſin divers waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it is the Cauſe of Gods withdrawing Grace from a man, which ſhould keep him from future ſins. And Covetouſneſs doth this. In <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.17. <hi>For the Iniquity of his Covetouſneſs I was wroth with him, and he went on in the way of his own heart. He went on:</hi> A ſpeech in the Hebrew which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the ſpeech of <hi>Cain</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. I ſhall go wandring up and down, ſaith he, and have none to protect me, and therefore ſhall be expoſed to the wrath of al men and Creatures. So ſaith God, from their Covetouſneſs it came to paſs that they went and did what they would. And how came
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:159991:120"/>this? for the Iniquity of his Covetouſneſs I hid my ſelf from him. Gods hiding, did go before their doing what they would: And Gods hiding was cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. One ſin may be the cauſe of another, becauſe it inclines the heart to another ſin. And in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Covetouſneſs is the root of al ſin, becauſe the Divel doth graft upon ſuch a heart what temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he pleaſeth. He obſerved <hi>Cain</hi> was covetous and that he had a mind to be building, He therefore makes him neglect the means of reconciling himſelf unto God for his ſin againſt his Brother. <hi>Judas</hi> was covetous, and he ſuggeſts to him to betray his maſter. <hi>Demas</hi> was an Apoſtate and he fel away by the meanes of covetouſneſs as appeares by the third Ground where the ſeed was ſowen among thornes, that is the covetous heart. As wood that is dry is on fire as ſoon as a ſparkle is put to it. In ſuch a temper is the ſoul when it is ful of the love of earthly things. I ſhal ſpeak more to that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p n="3">3. One ſin may be the cauſe of another, becauſe it adminiſters matter unto another. And ſo cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs breeds envying, and ſtrife, or diſſention with others. But it is ſaid to be the root of al ſin in another and higher ſenſe, and that is.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is both a Parent and a ruler of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins. Its a Parent to them. Out of the bowels of Covetouſneſs, comes pride. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high minded.</hi> And unbeleife: <hi>But truſt in the living God.</hi> And neglect of religion: for <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is Idolatry.</hi> And fraud and deceit, and unquietneſs, and hardneſs of heart. <hi>Take heed leaſt your hearts be hardned</hi> through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of riches. <hi>Pharoah</hi> (you know) was made by nothing ſo ſtout and ſtubborn againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:159991:120"/>of God to let the people of Iſrael go, as by this, That his profit ſhould go, he ſhould looſe the labor of ſo many men, and ſo many vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals.</p>
               <p>And as Covetouſneſs is a Parent to ſin, So its a Prince and Ruler over them. Thoſe ſins that do reſpect the ſelf ſame and are ruled by one another. Now becauſe that the end of Covetouſneſs is to get to a mans ſelf abundance, Therefore Covetouſneſs ſets on work the tongue, to lie, the hand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud, the underſtanding to plot, the Judgment to ſuſpect and doubt of God. The wil to make much of al advantages of Gain. Do but reckon up the children, and the childrens children, do but rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon up the ſubjects that are under this Prince, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and you ſhal find that al the whole Catalogue of ſins that can be named are one way or other, either deſcended from, or allyed unto it: In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. Saith the Apoſtle Comfort them, leaſt they be ſwallowed up by Satan, of ſorrow, for if you do not comfort them, ſaith he Satan wil take advantage of us, as it is tranſlated, but the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that we be not Covetous or uſed by Satan, or Satan do with us as with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous men: What is that? ſaith he, he leads them into al kind of ſin, and ſo he would us, To deny ordinances and meanes of Grace, and ſo we ſhould fil up our iniquity.</p>
               <p>To lay down but one thing more, wherein the ſinfulneſs of it may appear, And that is.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the baſeneſs of it. There is not a luſt that doth more debaſe a man then Covetouſneſs doth. Therefore its ſaid that a man is a ſervant to Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. <hi>You cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſeth the ſoul in its nature, for God Made it to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:159991:121"/>look after things not ſeen. It debaſeth a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in its poſture, for God hath made it tread upon the earth out of whoſe bowels it came: Look how unnatural it is for fowles to live in the earth, So its for the ſoul to be ſet upon the world. <hi>Becauſe the Corrupted Gentiles did not like to retayne God in their knowledg,</hi> Therefore he gave them up to Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. To ſhew you that its a lower ſtep and degree of miſery and ſinfulneſs for a man to be Covetous, Then its for a man to be borne without the Image of God by nature. It being made a ſpiritual Judgment, It is therefore a worſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then that men are in by ſin naturally. Now al this ſinfulneſs of ſin may be aggravated theſe two waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That here naturally we are in a ſtate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have no reaſon to look after the world and the things of it. We are Children of wrath, And what ſhould a reprieved condemned man do with purchaſing or looking after eſtates and poſſeſſions? For a man when he is dying to be gripple, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſaving: For a man when he hath his Soul to look after, and but a little time for that, to be looking after things which he ſhal never have any uſe of, argues a great profaneneſs of ſpirit: Now that is our Condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as it is aggravated from that, ſo from this. That it is needleſs too. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.32. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter al theſe things your heavenly Father takes Care.</hi> Chriſt ſaith the care of theſe outward things do lye upon God: Not only as he is a Father, but as a Creator. Though we be ſinners, yet we are Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Therefore he that cares for the Lillyes in the fields, and the fowles of the Ayre, wil care for man. In <hi>Mark,</hi> 7.20.21. From the heart comes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:159991:121"/>Covetouſneſs: It is not becauſe a man wants, nor becauſe a man may want, It is not for any thing in the world, but becauſe a man loves not God and ſpiritual things that a man is Covetous.</p>

               <p>Firſt, It is hardly to be avoyded. We count that infection to be dangerous and very ſtrong which kills luſty men, and that in a night, a day, or in a moment. Covetouſneſs hath undone the moſt ſtrong of men that are unregenerate, And it hath ſpoyled the ſtrongeſt of the regenerate. You ſhal find it to be in al ſorts of men, more or leſs in al Ages. In the heathen, In <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. In the profeſſors of Religion, the Jewes, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.20. In all ſorts of Profeſſors. <hi>David</hi> was a mighty man againſt ſin, A man able to overthrow whol troops
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:159991:122"/>as I may ſay, and yet this ſin incounters him, and and ſpoyls him. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was as much afraid of his Diſciples becauſe of Covetouſneſs, as he was of any ſin, becauſe Godly men wil be over run with this ſin, if they look not to it. <hi>Take beed</hi> (ſaith Chriſt In <hi>Luke,</hi> 21.34. unto his diſciples) <hi>That ye be not overcharged with the cares of this world.</hi> As often as I have read that place, it hath been a wonder to me, why Chriſt ſhould ſpeake ſo unto them. They were Godly people, and through grace their hear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> made as ſoy I that would not eaſily bring forth much bitter fruit: They were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into Chriſts ſervice upon theſe termes, that they ſhould look for nothing for their ſervice but perſecution: The time that Chriſt bids them take heed of the cares of this life was a perſecuting time when there was not only warre, and rumors of warre, but they were begirt by their enemies. Who would think that in winter time, any weeds ſhould appeare? If this weed ſhould ſhew it ſelf, one would think that this cold blaſt would have been able to have nipt it: But the diſciples that were Saints, The diſciples that were brought up alwayes in perſecution, yet in perſecution were very apt, and nothing would keep that down. When he would prepare them againſt the Judgment of the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and when he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to ſtand out againſt the times that they ſhould meet withal from the Apoſtate Jewes. He bids them beware of Covetouſneſs, In <hi>Math.</hi> 13.7. There you ſhal find that the third ground went further then either the firſt or the ſecond did: That Ground ſignifys a ſort of hearers that were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs and careleſs of what they heard, as the firſt ſort were, nor fearful of Perſecution, as the ſecond ſort were, They receiveied the word of God, and ſuddenly upon a preſent apprehenſion as the ſecond
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:159991:122"/>ſort did; but they did deliberate, and judg that it was better to walk holily, then to be at liberty, that a man had better be in chaines for a good cauſe then to be at liberty for the denyal of it. If you obſerve, The Holy Ghoſt chargeth them with no ſin almoſt; But with lawful things: And among them, with the cares of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches which did choak them, and by which they did become unfruitful. <hi>Demas</hi> was one of that ſort, for he ſtood with <hi>Paul</hi> when he was at Rome in his firſt tryal, when al elſe forſook him. The Epiſtle to the Coloſſians was written when <hi>Paul</hi> was in bonds: &amp; ſo was the Epiſtle to Philemon, for it was ſent by the ſervant of <hi>Phylemon,</hi> who waited upon Paul in the priſon: And in both thoſe Epiſtles <hi>Paul</hi> recommends <hi>Demas. Demas</hi> (ſaith he) ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes you, and he is my fellow labourer. No man ſtood by mee, that is, no man but <hi>Demas,</hi> and no man but <hi>Luke,</hi> When I came to anſwer it before the Emperour, al my acquaintance were ſhy of me and al the profeſſors at Rome would not know me, but <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> ſtood it out: And the doctrine that I propoſed they defended: and the reaſons that I gave they ſtuck to and argued; This he meanes by being a fellow labourer. Yet this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> that ſtood out one brunt, Yet when <hi>Paul</hi> comes to a ſecond, he forſakes him: And what is the reaſon, <hi>He cleaves unto this preſent world,</hi> in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. So that the beſt of regenerate and unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men find it hard work to eſcape the power of this ſin, One is foyled, and the other ſpoyled by it. This ſin doth prevail in formal profeſſors of Religion, in, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>They have a forme of Godlineſs:</hi> Why? A mong other ſins he ſaith they are covetous: <hi>Men ſhal be lovers of themſelves, and Covetous.</hi> Do but conſider how this ſin doth
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:159991:123"/>take men, and you wil ſee it is very hard to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. You ſhal find what the Apoſtle ſaith of the whol body of ſin. In <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22. That it doth corrupt men by deceit. <hi>Put off the old man that is corrupt according to the deceitful luſts.</hi> Look what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith there concerning al ſin, that the ſcripture ſaith concerning this one ſin of Covetouſneſs. In <hi>Math.</hi> 13.22. <hi>The deceitfulneſs of riches.</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs wil plead Conſcience of a mans calling: Care of Gods command to provide for a mans fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Yea the Glory of God. I would have more ſaith a man that ſo I may do more ſervice, and good. <hi>Saul</hi> did ſave the Cattel, but its ſaid, It was for ſacrifice. Covetouſneſs wil put a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on al duties of morality, and civility. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man whom God abhors ſaith the Pſalmiſt In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.10. He doth crouch and humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that is, he is as ſweet, and loving, and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and courteous, and as ſeemingly ready to do any office and ſervice for one, as any can be. Nay it wil put upon any ſpiritual duties. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was a great friend to the reformation of the Church of the Jews, But it was out of Covetouſneſs In 2. <hi>Kings,</hi> 6.10. And <hi>Ezra.</hi> 7.23. That ſo they may pray for the life of the King and of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that no wrath may come upon him, nor his Realme. Hewould give a toleration to thoſe poore baniſhed ones, that they might go to their own Country and ſet up the religion of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It wil make a man keep a good Miniſter in his houſe. In <hi>Judges,</hi> 17.13. I have a good Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite ſaith <hi>Micaiah,</hi> and now I know that God wil bleſs me ſaith he. It wil make a man not fail to heare the beſt ſermons: In <hi>John,</hi> 6.26. <hi>Ye follow me not for the Miracles,</hi> (that is, not for the diſcovery of God by me in working of Miracles, and that you may ſee in me more then a bare man, as my Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:159991:123"/>do diſcover me to be) but ye follow me for the Loaves. That people did go after Chriſt (the beſt of Preachers) a great many miles, and did run the reproach of the people of thoſe times. What made them to be the firſt at Church, but becauſe they thought God would the better provide for them, in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.5. Thoſe that are covetous at the ſecond verſe, have a form of Godlineſs. A form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is nothing but the picture of a thing to the life: when a thing is ſo like another by Art as that it can ſcarce be known, then it is ſaid to be a form. Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to be in the form of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was as like God, as could be: And in the form of a Servant, becauſe you would rather have thought him to be born to miſery than to be Lord of life. Covetouſneſs wil have a form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: He will do the ſame duties that any Godly man in the world doth. Faſting and praier is an extraordinary duty; a great affliction of the fleſh, it's a duty of the greateſt ſeeming holineſs that can be, yet in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 57.17. the Reaſon why they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſo often was but for Covetouſneſs, that they might put a greater face and a fairer ſhew upon their perſecuting the Brethren who did differ from them. When they had a mind to fall upon their Brethren for that which they ſhould have born with them in, then they call for a faſt, like the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codiles cry, that is only to get a prey. So like as a man may be to a Godly man, ſo like will Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs make a man be to him. If a Godly man praies, ſo will he: And if a Godly man forbears outward acts of groſs ſins, ſo will he: If a Godly man ſuffers, ſo will he. When God commends <hi>Job</hi> that there was not a man like him, ſaith the Devill, it is nothing for a man to do as he, when he hath ſo good wages for his work. Have you not given him much Riches, and Honor, and many
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:159991:124"/>Children in the world? And as it doth thus deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cheat a man, and is hardly to be avoided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeizeth upon all if they look not to it. So that you may ſee,</p>
               <p>Secondly: That it is hard to be Cured. And therefore in the Scripture you ſhal find (if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it) as many Arguments, nay more Arguments againſt Covetouſneſs, than againſt any ſin, except it be Unbelief. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. Jeſus Chriſt ſpends a whol Sermon almoſt againſt it. He doth ſo in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.

Look through the Goſpel and the Epiſtles, and you ſhall find that there are more Arguments againſt Covetouſneſs than any thing, but Unbelief: And wherefore, but becauſe it's a hard thing to cure it? And that you may further ſee that it's hard to be cured, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider how it deals with a man: The Scripture uſeth divers words to this purpoſe, ſomtimes it ſaith it doth divide a man: So the word uſually is which in the Scripture is tranſlated <hi>[Care]</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Care,</hi> ſignifies diviſion of ſpirit: It ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates a mans heart from God: It makes a man a Beaſt: To have a heart and a heart, and not to walk perfectly with him: It makes a man take Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the very throat in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22. for it did choak the word: And in <hi>Luke</hi> 12.29. ſaith the Text, <hi>Be not of a doubtfull mind.</hi> The word in the Greek is, Be not like unto Meteors. As Meteors and exhalations that are drawn from the Earth that hangs between the Earth and the ſtars; ſo wil Covetouſneſs make a man that he ſhall not be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally profane, nor throughly holy, neither in the upper region, nor in the lower region upon the duſt. He hath a ſpirit that is mingled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:159991:124"/>is on all ſides, but hearty for nothing that is good, or for ſalvation. Nay it goes further in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. <hi>Take heed leaſt your heart be overchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Gluttony, and Drunkenneſs, and the Cares of this life.</hi> Chriſt doth joyn Covetouſneſs with Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and Drunkenneſs, becauſe it hath the like ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon the Soul of a man, that they have upon the body of a man. When a man hath drunk extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, his underſtanding is ſenſleſs; and ſo is a man made by the Cares of this world. <hi>Be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercharged.</hi> The word ſignifies, Made heavy. His ſpirit is like lead, he hath no ſpirit in any thing that he doth for God, further than he is acted by the world. Of a meer ſpirituall duty, he hath no more feeling, than a ſtone hath. If there be not Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick in praier, and Invention in Sermons, it's not food to him. Nothing that is ſpirituall affects him, but his heart is like a ſtone. It's a ſtrange ſpeech in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.27. to this purpoſe, when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>It was as hard for a rich man to be ſaved, as for a Camell to go through the eye of a needle, And they ſaid then none of them can be ſaved,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The things which are impoſſible with men, are poſſible with God.</hi> Are poſſible with God: That word, I would inſiſt upon a little. There are ſome things that the Scripture ſaith are eaſie unto God. <hi>Do but ſpeak the word</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and my ſervant ſhall be healed.</hi> And there are ſome things that the Scripture ſaith are hard to God, there is more of God required to do them, than other things: And ſome things that are but poſſible unto God. As if he ſhould have ſaid: It's all that God can do: If there were but a whit of leſs ſtrength in him, he were not able to make a man that is covetous to beleeve. Give me leave to ſpeak with reverence according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: His ſtrength is matched, It's as much as he can do, It is but poſſible to him, to make a rich man
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:159991:125"/>that is in love with this preſent evil world to come to Heaven. And as if the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> could not ſay enough to ſhew the hardneſs of being cured of this ſin you ſhall find him heaping up words in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. There are Temptations, and there are Snares, and there are Sorrows: The word proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifies the pains of a Woman in Travel, which can neither be avoided, nor prevented, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be born long: And he ſaith they are drowned in perdition and deſtruction, having refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto the 18. Chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> at the 66. verſe, It was a kind of death to the Aſſyrians, to tie a Mill Stone about a mans neck, and to throw him into a deep water. Look how there is no hope of ſaving ſuch a man, ſo little hope there is of a covetous man. Obſerve it, he ſpeaks rather of ſuch a man that was covetous, who had made profeſſion of Religion, and known the truth rather than any other, and he ſaith of them, <hi>That they Pierce themſelves through.</hi> The word ſignifies, they do, as its ſaid of <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> that they came about him ſo with Bodkins and Swords, that his Body was as a Butt, or Pin-cuſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there was not a whole place in him, he was wounded in Back and Belly, in Armes and Legs, and in every part there was a wound. So ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle; You wil be by the Cares of this world, you will be run through and through and through with Cares and Sorrows: And what hope is there of a man when he lives thus; when ſin hath ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of him, how hard a matter is it to be cured.</p>
               <p>I have bin the longer in the explication becauſe it is the ſin of the times, and the ſin of Profeſſors.</p>

               <p>FOllow your Callings. For the living in a particular calling is as neceſſary to pluck down the rankneſs of a mans ſpirit, and to make him fit to ſerve God, I ſay it is as neceſſary in its kind, as the word is in its kind. There are ſome ſins that ariſe from the body, and diligence in a particular calling, mortifies them. Follow your Callings. Take what providence caſts upon you in them: but be not ſollicitous Beloved. Do not care how it may be with you, ſo you may but provide for eternity: Be content with a little ſo you may but have Grace: If you have Food and Raiment be quiet. As upon a day of faſt a man may eat ſo much as may fit him to the work: ſo my Beloved care for no more all the time of your life than what may keep you from temptations, and inable you to the work of your Calling. And that work of your calling, you may certainly do for God, whatever your condition be. Turn all your care unto this, that you may trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:159991:126"/>up riches in Heaven. What matter it if you be poor, or have, or not have, as long as you do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Chriſt. This is the great exhortation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in this place. That time that men ſpend in forecaſting how they ſhould do in ill times (that time is all loſt) and ſhould be ſpent only in this, How they may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 words">

Be not afraid of any evill that can befall you: fear nothing but ſin and Gods wrath. It is your wiſdom to do ſo. A wiſe man on a Journey cares not if his lodging be hard, and diet courſe, becauſe he is upon his way, and thinks to have better at home. The love of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs makes him not think of theſe things. What is your buſineſs but to provide for Heaven? What is your home, but to dwell with Jeſus Chriſt, and to have Communion with him! Therefore mind not other things, never be troubled what you are in other reſpects.</p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:159991:126"/>the world, that does but mind the things of him. He were an unjuſt maſter to ſet us a work, and to leave us to our own finding. Is it not better a great deal to be at Gods hand than at your own? That he ſhould find you, than your ſelves? Therefore ſpeak to your hearts after this manner. I cannot by my care add one Cubit to my ſtature, and make one buſineſs go well, and get in one debt, and take one penny the more, and get one new Cuſtomer. Let me ſpeak to you in your own language. If ſo be that I do what I can, it wil be no advantage to me in theſe things. But if I be careful to make my peace with God, to get my pardon Sealed, to get my waies San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, God wil give me ſo much of theſe as I need, he hath enough, and he wil give me liberally, ſo that I ſhall have no cauſe to complain. If I have not ſo much as another, yet notwithſtanding I ſhall have a bleſſing with what I have, and that will be more than anothers much. If men did put themſelves upon this, that it is to be their care to look to their Souls, and when they have uſed meanes for their eſtates and bodies, to leave all to God's diſpoſing, and did beleeve that then God would bleſs them, How many then would give that precious time, ſtrength and Spirit which now runs out to the world, unto the ſervice of God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If every one that would attain to eternall life muſt take heed of Covetouſneſs. Then let all your care be for eternall life, to be rich in God, as Chriſt ſaith in verſe 21. <hi>Be rich in God,</hi> that is, in the things of God, and in the things that are for Gods Glory. God doth not call you from the world to put you upon a loſs, but to turn your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon the right Object. It's not to undo
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:159991:127"/>you, but to make you in better things. As Parents when they would wean the Child from the Nurſe unto themſelves, they make the nurſes breaſt black, and they fear the Child. So ſaith Chriſt, take heed, and look to your ſelves, when he hath no other end in it, but that he may have your love, and you have his at length. <hi>Many will ſay,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.7.8. <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> but ſaith he, <hi>Thou haſt put more gladneſs into my heart, than when Corn and Wine increaſe.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, when the Devill ſees men inquiring after hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and ſalvation, he does ſhew them good: he preſently meets them as <hi>Abraham</hi> did the Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites wih Corn and Wine, the things of this life, and takes off their hearts from happineſs. And it is ſo prevailing a means,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 4.9.</note> that he betook himſelf to that alone when he tempted Chriſt. <hi>All this will I give thee.</hi> When he had ſhewed him all the Glory of the world, that is, when he had made the world as glorious as poſſible it could be to the mind of Chriſt. He did not do unto Chriſt, as unto us, deceive our fancies, but he put the greateſt Glory upon Riches that could be, and then he thought that Jeſus Chriſt would bow down to him. If the Devil cannot make a man as prophane and as looſe as he deſires, then he will make a man Religious, but mingle Covetouſneſs with it. He will ſtir up a man, as it is reported by one that writes of the walkings and appariſions of the Devill, The Devil came to many a man in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them to ſtand for Juſtication and lay aſide po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Religion, but he told them alſo they ſhould get ſo much by the bargain: And when he mingled this Poyſon with that Wine, he did bring them to as much formality as they were in before in their ignorance: They were as bad as before, becauſe of only their Covetouſneſs. When he hath once got a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:159991:127"/>man under his power, he wil make him to grind at this mil, as they did <hi>Sampſon.</hi> Therefore the Love of the world is called in. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. The Devils ſnare and bond, And it is the ſin of the Jews by which they were and are kept from embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Chriſt, They did look after an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Be not hindred of true happineſs by thoſe things. Barter not away your ſouls for an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the things of this life: Let not your minds run out after what you ſee, or what is to be had, beſides grace and holineſs and communion with God. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is moved to ſee one got into good Company here in this Chapter at the 13. verſe. ſeeming to have an inheritance here to neglect to get Salvation and Grace. Grace and the favor of God are true riches, and al other things are not ſo. They are but ſhadows of riches, and therefore called a fancy. <hi>Agrippa</hi> his po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

That is, Riches are but a particular good that may ſerve a mans ſelf, but that is all it can do: It makes a man leave God who is a univerſal good. That only is true Riches which doth procure to a man all good: and that, nothing can do, but what comes from God which is Grace.</p>

That is as much as a man doth either need or deſire, if his deſires be rational and ſpiritual It gives content. The word that the Apoſtleuſeth for content, is a word that is uſed among Common wealths, that have al things in themſelves, and need not other Countries. Religion needs not be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to any eſtate, and condition, or any thing in this world for any thing that belongs to this life.

Let any be of a liberal ſpirit, willing to part with what God gives him, when God doth cal, and that man never wants. Men that have dogs appetites are never ſatisfied: When meat feeds humors, then parents deny their children meat: So doth God, when he ſees what he gives, doth not work conformity to his wil. Do you mind your work, and God wil care for your maintenance. And you ſhal have ſpiritual things at a better rate, and on eaſier terms then you have earthly things. The paines you take for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhal bring you in communion with God, which cannot be got by your indeavors, God wil not put you to more, nor ſo much in working for him, as you put your ſelves to in getting the world. Wicked men have been at death convinced of this. Had I (ſaith one) been as good a ſervant to God, as to the King, I had been happy. Yea thoſe that know
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:159991:128"/>better what it is to prepare for Heaven than others, do complain that they are not ſo carefull for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, as they are for the things of this life. When they go about Riches, or the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Riches, they are buried in the buſineſs, and there their thoughts are intent, but at prayer and Hearing their Thoughts are divided, and their Hearts are wandering: and yet ſtill they grow in Grace. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.2. <hi>It's in vain to go to bed late, or riſe up early: ſo he gives his Beloved ſleep:</hi> that is without this carking care, he gives them ſleep: that ſleep, is a Lying in the Lap of God and being put into his Boſome, as well as having enough of this world. <hi>Labor not for the meat that periſheth,

It's reported of a Noble man when he had divided all his Eſtate, he ſaw a Toad in the room, and he cries out, Oh that I were as that Toad to eternity. Call to this and that Eſtate and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:159991:129"/>inheritance at death, And they will anſwer it is not in me, I am not able to do any thing for you: When a man comes to die (who hath lived upon God in the world) he can ſpeak comfortably thus, That he ſhall change only his place, and not his company; for he hath parted with theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. When you appear before God, you ſhal not appear as rich, but according to what you have done for him, and what you have done through Grace: Therefore naked came I into the world and muſt go ſo out. Men do not ſtand before God as Kings and Knights: But thoſe that have done for God, ſhall be honored in that day; but that which enters a man into Gods Glory is Grace. Conſider what a folly it is to ſtrive for ſhadows, to undo your ſelves, to tire your ſelves in following after Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies? What a madneſs it is to give thouſands for that which is worth nothing? To ſpend your time impertinently for things in which your life is not? Therefore when you have wearied your ſelves in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, &amp; plotting, and deſigning of waies for to get an abundance for your ſelves, ye cover your ſelves and ſay, Had this day been ſpent otherwiſe, or had I laid out my ſelfe as much for God, as for theſe things, it had been well, All this time is loſt: If I had been in ſpirituall duties and ſervices, as long as I have been for the body, it had been well. When you have gotten the world, and have not caſt up your accompt what you have done, when you have cared for the Body and not for the Soul, when you have gotten all, you have gotten but a common ſtone, and loſt the Diamond. Therefore when you hear Jeſus Chriſt calling upon you to take heed, his meaning is not to deprive you of any good that the world can give you, but to make you ſure of eternity. Therefore turn your thoughts this way. He caſeth men of taking care of this
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:159991:129"/>world, that ſo they may attend to eternity. It is not becauſe Jeſus Chriſt would not have the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this life fulfilled, that he bids them to take heed, but becauſe he would have you to have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the things which are indeed true Riches.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. So Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt tels men, there are ſnares and pits in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: yet men wil not be perſwaded. I ſhall give you but two ſigns to prove that men do not believe there is ſuch danger in Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt: Men will not come near that wherein they think there is danger. When <hi>David</hi> ſaw the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord ſtanding over <hi>Gideon</hi> with the ſword in the time of the plague, He would not come near that place to offer Sacrifice: There was danger there, and in that caſe, God would have mercy rather than Sacrifice, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.6. We will not come near the Perſons that have the plague: we keep out of the way where Theeves lie, though we go further about, becauſe there is danger. But men come near occaſions of Covetouſneſs by taking all opportunities and advantages of getting, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying themſelves, by contemplating and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their own wants, and of others Riches. As <hi>David</hi> did confeſs in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. that he looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he found every day, and how the eyes of wicked men (that knew not God) were ready to ſtart out of their Heads, becauſe of their fatneſs, therefore he complains: Whereas he ſaith, he ſhould have gone into the Sanctuary, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the end of thoſe men, how they ſtand in ſlippery places. The conſideration of a mans own wants, and the thinking much of other mens abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, is that which gives an occaſion unto Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs. Whenever a man comes to think of the world (as men take a Preſervative when they go into infectious Air) ſo men ſhould think of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and miſery of rich and covetous men. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſhould have done.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:159991:130"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It may be ſaid by the way. <hi>May not a man take all opportunities of getting and enriching himſelf? Is that to play with a Bait of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer yes. You may not do all you can or may do in the world. In <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. Chriſt bids them that they ſhould as well take heed of Covetouſneſs and the Cares of this life, in verſe 34. as they ſhould take heed of Surfeiting and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs. <hi>Take heed leaſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with Drunkenneſs and Surfeiting, as wel as the Cares of this life.</hi> Chriſt joyns Surfeiting and Drunkenneſs with Covetouſneſs. Therefore as a man may not drink all he can bear, nor eat all his ſtomack requires, but riſe with an appetite: No more muſt a man in the things of the world do all he can. This is gathered from the Conjunction of thoſe two together, Covetouſneſs and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In things that are not good in themſelves, but profitable only in ſome way to an end there muſt be a meaſure in the uſe of them. As a Builder doth not lay all the ſtones he can in the Houſe, but ſo many as the foundation will bear, leaſt he over laies it. The end of a mans Calling is only this, that he may exerciſe himſelf the more freely in the waies of God. As I have often ſaid. It is the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſoyl ground fallow, that the rankneſs and ſourneſs of it may be removed, obſtacles that are in the fleſh unto the holy duties may be taken away. The end of Riches is only that a man may do the work that God ſets him and cals him to do, and therefore beyond that he ought not to ingage himſelf in the world, nor to deſire riches. But this is by the way, for I reſerve other Caſes to another place. That ſhews that men beleeve there is no
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:159991:131"/>Snare in riches, becauſe they put themſelves upon the occaſions and temptations of Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly: There is another ſign, which is this, Becauſe men place their happineſs in riches, which appear by this. Mens deſires are more eaſily ſtirred, more vehemently ſet on, and hardlier taken off from the things of the world, of this life, than from any thing. To duties, men are drawn hardly, are ſoon weary, are eaſily diſcouraged; but are not ſo in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after the things of this life. When men have gotten riches then they count themſelves happy: Therefore it is, that when they loſe or want them, they count themſelves to be in a moſt deplorable &amp; ſad condition. No man counts himſelf to be unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the want of that which would not <hi>Make</hi> him, in his own opinion. Therefore when men think al is gone, when the world is gone, frowns upon you, It's a ſign they make the world their God, and do not think it a Snare. To perſwade you therefore to the believing of this, that it's a ſnare, or that there is a ſnare in it, I ſhall only remove (in a word or two) the ground of that perſwaſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Men think if they had more of the world, they could do more for God, more good than they do. As <hi>Abſalom</hi> ſaid if he were King he would do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And relieve the oppreſſed, break the bonds, free men from taxes that his Father laid upon them: So men think that if they were but as rich as another man, they would diſtribute to the Saints, Cloath the naked, feed the hungry, their houſes ſhould be like the houſe of <hi>Caius,</hi> an Inn for them: They would ſerve God more freely. This now doth ſuppoſe that there is an help in abundance, and not a hook. I beſeech you my Beloved conſider it, when men have had abundance, though they have been put in
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:159991:131"/>mind, and cautionated continually, that therefore they have it that they may ſerve God in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things, they have found their hearts ſtraigter, and their hands weaker, than when they were in poverty, or in a mean condition. <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſaith God unto the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and he reads them that leſſon every morning that they took a Journey into the land <hi>Canaan</hi>) <hi>leaſt when you come into the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>that you do forget the Lord your God, and not keep his Statutes and Judgments to do them.</hi> Yet notwithſtanding for all this, when as they were come into the land, as it's ſaid in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> they did not ſerve the Lord their God in the abundance of all things, but they ſerved themſelves and their own luſts. Had you been by the ſelf ſame people when they were in the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> you might have heard them groaning and ſighing out for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Thus: Deliver us and we will ſerve thee: our ſtrange Gods ſhall be put away from us, we wil build <hi>Thy Altar, and none elſe,</hi> we will offer unto thee the fat of the Calf &amp; of the Steer, but when they came into the land as we have ſhewed out of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> they did delight themſelves in the fatneſs of the land, and forgat the Commandments of the Lord.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you my Beloved conſider it. A man is to content himſelf with the doing of that good (though it be never ſo little) which God cals him to do. That Servant honors his Maſter as wel that continually waits upon him, and goes whither he goes, as he that doth in the houſe the greateſt drudgery. God doth not call a man to all that he thinks he could do, or it may be that he hath abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to do. A man is called to no more than God puts him upon, and puts himſelf forth unto. As for example. A man may have able gifts, but
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:159991:132"/>that is not enough to make him a Miniſter nor a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. A man may do the work of other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but that is not enough to make him put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into them, til God ſaith, Do this. He muſt do that which God puts into his hand, let it be what it wil be. We are often times ready to think that we ſhould do God more ſervice in any condition, than in that wherein we are. Like fooliſh children at School that think they ſhall gain more by going into a new Book, than by going on in the old, though the Maſter knows the beſt way to make them underſtand, is to keep them where they are. It ſhews our diſcontent through Pride, and our liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs to do the work of God, that makes us ſay, If I had this, I would do thus, and if I had that, I would do ſo. Do that which is in thy hand. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is no ground at all for a man to deſire more, becauſe he thinks he ſhould do more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another Reaſon that perſwades men to look after the things of this life, is, becauſe they think that if they had abundance of the things of this life, they ſhould eſcape many evils which now they meet withall. But now I ſhall anſwer nothing more than the words that follows my Text, <hi>A mans life conſiſts not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</hi> You ſhall live never a whit the better, nor have any thing the more to live upon for abundance. <hi>Your life,</hi> that is, the ſafety of it, that lies not in abundance: for riches are an allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto thoſe that are the ſons of violence. The Comfort of your life lies not in abundance; for abundance brings forth care and ſorrow: The more you have, the more your heart will be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſolicitouſneſs about them. If abundance is not able to continue your life (for as Chriſt ſheweth, <hi>that your life depends upon the word of God
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:159991:132"/>This night thy Soul ſhall depart from thee</hi>) much leſs can you help your ſelves to eternal life by abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, You cannot purchaſe it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7. That is a Purchaſe that muſt be let alone, No man is able to give the thouſand part of the purchaſe of it, if he had all the world to give. No you are not able to purchaſe it. Covetouſneſs breeds liſtleſneſs of ſpirit and a ſenſleſneſs of the things that are eternal. As while a man looks upon the Sun, he cannot well ſee other things, So while a man is in the Earth and darkneſs, he cannot well bear the light of the Sun, ſo a man whoſe ſpirit is accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the care of this cannot well get his heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to converſe with God. Therefore ſet this down with your ſelves, that abundance is rather to be feared than deſired. Riches are rather Pricks, than Thrones, rather Rocks whereon you daſh your ſelves, than any thing that will do you good; to help you to the end whereunto you are deſigned, and born withall for by God. That ſhal ſuffice for this uſe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>MOrtifie therefore your deſires after Riches and abundance. Diet your ſelves in theſe things, as your would run the Race, and have the Crown. In <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Mortifie</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>your members that are upon the Earth, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, Adultery, evil concupiſcence, and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> That which I ſhall deſire you to obſerve is this, That the Apoſtle doth put a great many ſins together, as thoſe which are to be ſlain, and among them, Covetouſneſs is one. He joyns it with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs. Becauſe as you are to be afraid of the firſt tickling to that ſin, ſo you ought to be of the firſt motion unto the love of the world: The firſt motion of diſcontent with a mans preſent ſtate,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:159991:133"/>ſhould be mortified, as well as the firſt motion to Adultery. As a ſevere and cruell Conqueror fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his Souldiers, and bids them kil and ſlay, and not give quarter unto any, but eſpecially he names ſome perſons which he would have them be ſevere againſt: So doth the Apoſtle bid them to mortifie all ſins, but eſpecially he names Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Ceaſe not my Beloved therefore to purſue it, til you have ſlain it: And know that you have not ſlain and killed it, until you can delight your ſelves and rejoyce in your preſent Condition, though you have but a ſmal portion of the things of this life. Then I ſay Covetouſneſs is mortified, when as a man doth delight and rejoyce himſelf, though that he hath but a very ſmal portion of the things of this life. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.4. ſaith <hi>David, Delight thy ſelf in the Lord,</hi> his meaning is this, Be as cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, pleaſantly, contented, if you have but God, as if you had together with him al the world: In the outward portion that God gives you, delight in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in the verſes before he had ſpoken of wicked men as thoſe that flouriſhed like a Tree in the ſpring, and proſpered and increaſed in al things, But ſaith he unto the Godly, delight thy ſelf in the Lord, that is, though you be not ſo though you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper not, though you be like a Tree that is withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. A mans happineſs is not in abundance, for a man is not one Inch nearer Heaven for al the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Gold that he hath.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore now unto the putting you upon this Duty, give you ſome motives: And when I have done that, ſome tryals.</p>
               <p>The motives are of two ſorts, they are either ſuch as are taken out of the Armory of Reaſon, ſuch as the Common light which even the Heathen had from God do afford.</p>
               <p>Or elſe they are ſuch as are taken out of the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:159991:134"/>Scripture from ſupernaturall and Gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt: Be contented with what you have, for your happineſs doth not lie in abundance, nor in any thing that doth belong to this life. Were your happineſs in riches, then your deſires ought to be infinite and boundleſs, to be ſet upon them for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But if ſo be that you have riches, you are not the better, and if you want them, you are not the worſe: Al the things of this life are for you. You are their end, &amp; your end is God. Theſe do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you unto him. The Poor receive the Goſpel. With him it's all one whether you be bond or free, ſo you be in Jeſus Chriſt, and but a new Creature. Take al the riches in the world together, and they are not able to take away the pains and miſeries of your bodies. A Crown of Gold upon the head wil not keep it from aching. A Scepter in the hand wil not cure the Palſie. <hi>Herods</hi> Riches and Glory could not kil a Worm. Much leſs then are they able to ſatisfie your Conſciences, or to get you fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor with God.</p>
               <p>Nay my Beloved let me add this, that if you wil not be contented with that portion God gives you, your are further off from Gods favor by them, when the Apoſtle in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5. had named Covetouſneſs in verſe 6. he ſaith, <hi>For ſuch things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of diſobedience.</hi> Mark it. He doth not put Uncleanneſs or Fornication laſt, that ſo he might faſten the danger, and the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the wrath of God againſt it, but he names Covetouſneſs laſt, and he ſaith, <hi>For that the wrath God &amp;c.</hi> the word properly ſignifies, a vindictive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire: A hanging after ones ruine; A being unſatisfied until ſuch time as he hath deſtroyed: As far as ſuch a kind of affection can be attributed unto God juſtly, ſo far you are to apprehend it in him againſt
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:159991:134"/>thoſe that are Covetous. And that not ſometimes but alwayes, for ſaith he, <hi>the wrath of God is come,</hi> or for ſuch things the wrath of God comes. He doth not ſay, It ſhal come, but he ſaith it is come. I ſay the wrath of God is a deſire of revenge: and he ſaith not that it ſhal come, but that it is come. The ſin of Covetouſneſs is a puniſhment to it ſelf, &amp; brings puniſhments every day one on the neck of the other, for ſaith he, for this the wrath of God comes. So that a mans happineſs is not in riches, for the deſire of riches keeps a man from happineſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Your deſire after Riches puts a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and excellency upon them which is not native, or which belongs not to them of themſelves. For what a man doth ſo deſire as that he cannot be content to be without it, In that very act of deſire he makes it better then al he hath, and neceſſary for what he wants and ſufficient if he had it to do him good. He that deſires them placeth a happineſs in them, and a beſt part of his happineſs in the things of this life. Happineſs conſiſts of a good that is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and moſt deſireable and pleaſurable, that gives a man delight, But eſpecially it conſiſts of a good that is ſufficient. And therefore when as God tells <hi>Moſes</hi> that he would ſhew him Glory, he would ſhew him that which would do him al good. This then being the principal thing in happineſs, as a voluptuous man gives the pleaſure that is in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs unto his luſt, And the Ambitious man gives the excellency that is in happineſs unto honor, ſo now the Covetous man placeth ſufficiency in his riches. I ſay he placeth ſufficiency in his riches, And that is the reaſon that you find in 1 <hi>John,</hi> 2.16. That al that is in the world is either the luſts of eye, the luſts of the fleſh, or the pride of life, and that the love of God cannot be in thoſe that love
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:159991:135"/>them. They that ſeek them cannot be made happy by them. The fume of the motive is this. That as the Prophet ſaid, the Idolater did take a peece of Tymber, and hewed it, and made an Image of it and then fel down and worſhipped it: So men do Imagin a ſufficiency in riches, and then their deſires are carried after them. Now what a ſin is it for a man to place happineſs in the Creature, nay the worſt of Creatures, that which God (who judgeth righteouſly) reckons to be nothing but earth and thick clay? What a folly and madneſs is it for a man to be a ſervant to that which he hath made great? As it is folly and frenſy for a man to imagin himſelf to be a King, and then to ſwel with his own imagination, and to ſtand bowing unto his own ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. That is the ſecond motive, you put honour and glory upon the things of this life, if you are not contented with the portion which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you of them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Riches are not deſirable. There is not in them that which ſhould draw the heart after them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God hath not made the things of this life the firſt object of deſires, for God hath not made them for that end to make men happy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That you know is not deſirable which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had: And riches cannot be had if they be deſired. Deſires after them is the way to hinder the getting of them: For either thou art good, and then God as a father wil correct thee if thou art diſcontented with his allowance, God wil correct that diſpoſition and not humor it. Or thou art bad and then in <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.20.21. <hi>He that makes haſt to be rich ſhal not be innocent;</hi> ſaith the Text: And that Innocency is put in oppoſition to abundance in the former part of the verſ. <hi>A faithful man ſhal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:159991:135"/>with bleſſings, but he that makes haſt to be rich ſhal not be innocent.</hi> I ſay, to be innocent, is put in oppoſition to abundance, to abounding with bleſſings: The meaning is that he ſhal not abound with beſſings, that ſuch a man (as a Guilty perſon) ſhal be cut off, and never ſee the day of great things which he longs after. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. God is aſhamed to be called the God of wicked men, becauſe of their Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Deſires wil not help a man to riches, becauſe when a man makes them the matter of his prayer, he provokes God. The way of God giving riches, is rather caſual, then as an anſwer of prayer. God wil not have riches come in by prayer, that men may not ſet too great a price upon them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its obſervable when Chriſt taught us to pray, There are five requeſts for the things of another life but for this life, there is but one petition, viz. <hi>Give us this day our dayly bread.</hi> That is, ſo much bread as wil ſerve for the day, the meaneſt kind of food that a man can live upon, <hi>for if a man have food and rayment, he ought therewith to be contented.</hi> God hath appointed you to pray for dayly bread, and for a bleſſing upon the uſe of meanes, but he hath not given a ſpirit of prayer for theſe things chiefly. That is not the fruitfulleſt ground that is fulleſt of Gold and Silver. They are not the beſt perſons that have moſt Gold, for God gives riches careleſly as it were.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Riches are not deſirable becauſe they wil not ſatisfy; natural deſires are to be after ſuch things, which being had will ſatisfy. As a hungry man deſires meat that wil take away his hunger. But as Riches increaſe, ſo alſo do mens deſires. Men do but feed upon the wind, when they have them, they have a lye in their right hand: A man
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:159991:136"/>finding himſelf to be at a loſs, when he ſtill labours after more, and he thinks to have that bring him in contentment, which wil not. If any man ſhould have contentment in the world, it ſhould have been thoſe who have been conquerers of it, into whoſe purſes what ever the habitable earth yielded was brought, who were to command over them, as men over beaſts, who had gifts as the ſtones of the ſtreets, yet theſe men have not been ſatisfyed. <hi>Ahab</hi> was a king and yet was more troubled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanted a plott of ground which lay neare his, then he was contented with al his Revenues. <hi>Alexander</hi> when he had as much as he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, then he began to be troubled that there was not another world to be conquered. Yea there is a great deal of diſ-ſatisfaction in al riches, &amp; therfore becauſe a man hath his ſoul inlarged through a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Judgment, though his conſcience is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that there is nothing in them but vanity.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Again, that is not deſirable which there is no pleaſure in when a man hath it. The more a man hath of riches, the more he hath of ſorrow. As the Apoſtle ſaith in. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. <hi>They that wil be rich pierce themſelves through with many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</hi> But beſides al theſe things.</p>

For this is the cuſtom of the Hebrew and Greek tongue, when it uſeth the manner of Speech of the Hebrews, when it would ſet forth a thing to the ful, To name it by ſuch a ſin as is confeſſed of al hands to be hainous. I ſay, the name of a thing that is confeſſed of al hands to be hainous, is given unto thoſe things which the Holy Ghoſt would ſet forth to the ful. As for example. In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. The ſin of <hi>Saul</hi> is called witchcraft. <hi>Rebellion is as witchcraft. Saul's</hi> ſin was not wichcraft: But only witchcraft was a confeſſed known ſin. To ſet out <hi>Saul's</hi> ſin, <hi>Samuel</hi> calls it ſo. So that the greatneſs of the ſin of Covetouſneſs may appeare, the text calls it Idolatry. As if it ſhould have been ſaid. The worſhip of another God provokes not God more to Jealouſy, then the love of the world doth.

And its not only in that place called Idolatry, but you have as ill names given it elſewhere. <hi>James</hi> 4.4. <hi>You Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and Adultereſſes, know you not that the love of the world is enmity unto God.</hi> It is called Adultery. And as Adultery doth break the bonds between the Husband and the Wife, And as Adultery is a ſin that is committed when there is no need, becauſe the party hath a remedy which God in the ſtate of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage hath given: So the love of the world ſtrikes at the knot, at the uniting Graces, Faith and Love, It puts a man into a Condition wherein (if in any) he is capable of a divorce from God. If I would ſay there was a poſſibility of a mans falling from Grace, I would ſay ſo of Covetouſneſs and Idolatry, becauſe both theſe are called Adultery, which doth diſſolve the bond. What need you take care, when God doth? What reaſon have you, when God makes it his work to provide for you, as he doth for the Lallies of the Fields, than which you are
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:159991:137"/>much better? What reaſon is there then that you ſhould ſet your ſelves to that buſineſs? Is it not enough that you have God? And that God wil be ſure to find you all the ſtock that he wil have you to work withal for him? It is Adultery: And mark what follows, <hi>The friendſhip of the world is enmity againſt God.</hi> That is, A Covetous man doth (as it were) ſend an Herald of Armes and bids defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt God himſelf. In 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.15. <hi>If a man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Mark it. As it is an unnnatural thing for the Child not to love the father that begat him, ſo it's an unnatural thing for a man not to love God, And yet Covetouſneſs will make a man to be ſo unnatural. Sometimes you ſhal find in the ſpirits of good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a careleſneſs of God: The indearedneſs that they had to him at another time, is not to be found upon them. They are not tender of his diſpleaſure. They are not deſirous to live in his favor: What is the Reaſon? What is it that makes a Soul ſo unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural? It is becauſe his Soul is So taken up with the things of this world.</p>
               <p>And that you may yet ſee further the evill of this ſin, know, that it keeps Gods love from a man. For if the love of God be not in a man that loves the world, then the love of God is not ſhed abroad in the heart of that man that loves the world. For whom God loves they ſhall certainly love him again. But above all, that which is the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and with which I would perſwade you, Is this.</p>
               <p>You ought to be conformable to the wil of God. Either his will or yours muſt rule. Either he or you muſt be acknowledged to be the wiſe, and right Diſpoſer of things. If there be wiſdom with him, and that all things are under him, and his power, Why are you not then contented with that which
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:159991:138"/>is his allowance to you? It is fit the Phyſitian ſhould preſcribe the Dyet, and not the ſick perſon. It's ſit the Maſter ſhould ſet down how he wil keep, and not the Servant how he wil be kept, by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Conformity to the wil of God doth extend not only to ſpiritual things, ſo that a man may not ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any moral precept, but unto lawful things, ſo that a man ſhould think it beſt with him, according to Gods way of diſpenſing to him. And there is no reaſon in the world why a man ſhould think that he is dealt hardly with, if his portion be but ſmal, for was not the ſtate of Jeſus Chriſt very low? He became poor, he had not whereon to lay his head. Were not thoſe Princes (as I may cal them) that ſate upon the Throne, Judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I mean the Apoſtles and the primitive Saints, Were not they in hunger and nakedneſs, and in want of all things, cloathed in Goats and Sheep Skins? of whom the world was not worthy? Will it not content you that you are kept in the ſame manner that God kept his Son, while he was in the world?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> You will ſay. <hi>Therefore Jeſus Chriſt was poor, becauſe by the want of all things he was to ſatisfie</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> But for whom was it, that he was to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie? was it not for you? If it was for you, Is there not reaſon that you ſhould be contented to be poor if he pleaſe? Shal the Creditor be willing that the Surety ſhould pay his debt, and ſhal not the Principal or he that is the Debtor be willing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to part with that which he hath? Jeſus Chriſt, It is true did merit by the want of theſe things, But what did he merit? He merits this among other things, that you ſhould be an Example that he had taken the ſting and miſery out of poverty and the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:159991:138"/>want of all things. As we are therefore tempted that God may ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt conquered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ſo we are therefore poor, that though our ſins have robbed us, yet there is no curſe in our poor Eſtate. Let me therefore for a concluſion of al at this time, ſtir you up, that you would not deſire after much.</p>
               <p>Let me ſpeak to you that are rich. Be unto all you have, as a man is unto his meat who is ſick, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no deſire at all to it. Have ſuch a ſtomach to riches, as a man of a ful ſtomack hath to his meat. Let it be al one to you whether you have or have not. Though you have Eſtates, let not your Eſtates have your affections. You that are in the waies of gaining and getting, that are in the ſpring of the world, that have ful trades, and great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, Take what God gives you, but take it as that which is to be laid by you, not as your own, but as that which you muſt lay up, and lay out for God for the uſe he cals for, and not as that which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to make you great. Uſe Riches as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points.</p>
               <p>You that are poor, be content, and murmur not: for riches are rather things to be feared than deſired. Beware of Covetouſneſs. Feed upon God and Chriſt, and the hopes of another world, If you have not enough to ſatisfie the outward man. And that is no hard Counſel: for if a covetous man can ſatisfie himſelf with a little, by feeding upon the hopes of what he ſhal heap together, either for an after day, or for his poſterity, there is then a nouriſhment, and a ſuccor, and a food much more in the feeding upon and thinking of Honor, and Glory, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and eternal life. If you be content to want, God will let you have: If you be contented, God will provide for you. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Let your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be without Covetouſneſs, and be content with
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:159991:139"/>that you have, for he hath ſaid, he will never leave nor forſake.</hi> Feed upon God and Chriſt and the hopes of another world, and the more you do ſo, the leſs wil your condition be diſcontentful to you.</p>
               <p>Yea my Beloved, Let me ſpeak to you that are Godly. How uncomely a thing is it for you to mind earthly things? Is your God your Belly? Are your hopes and your treaſures here? The more Goſpel Chriſtians you are, the more contented you will be with a little of the world. For when God in the old Teſtament gave but little Grace, then he gave much riches: The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and their great and large inheritances, were all of them but ſo many Ceremonies, and ſhadows and Types of the large portion which the Saints are to have in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things by Jeſus Chriſt. As the Apoſtle therfore ſaid unto the Galatians when they were returning unto the Circumciſion, Have you begun in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and will you make an end in the Fleſh? So I ſay unto you, you go back again unto Types and ſhadows. You do ſo when God hath brought you to the land of true good, if you return unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after riches. Cloaths that are too big for a man have neither warmth nor comlineſs in them. If you deſire more than God gives, you have loſt the comlineſs and the profit and health that may be by the bleſſing of God in Riches to you.</p>
               <p>A word let me ſpeak to you all. Covetouſneſs is the ſin that now doth begin to ſprout and bud. And there is nothing that is a ſadder preſage of the wrath of God againſt us, than the ſtraightneſs of mens hearts. It is reported there was a great deal of wealth in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> when the Turk took it, but he took all and brought them into ſlavery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not lay it forth to maintain a juſt war againſt him. Of another place it is reported,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:159991:139"/>that it was loſt, not ſo much by the force of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, as by the Covetouſneſs of thoſe that ſhould have provided oppoſition againſt the enemy. If you do but lend you eares a little to men, you ſhal find them murmuring at their Taxes; you ſhal find them complaining at their not getting as they have done, That they are willing to be any thing, rather then further to be at charges: To looſe what they have taken in hunting, rather then to be at the charge to dreſs and roſt it, As I may uſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ſcripture. In the beginning of theſe late troubles, I wiſh it be not laid to our charge, the charge of thoſe who were ſo forward and free to lend in an animoſity, when that which they fought for is now brought to their doores, is ſcarce worth acceptance. A folly, Like unto thoſe who travel to the Eaſt-Indies to fetch home things that are not of a price and eſteem. Some indeed have been overcharged and burdened: But it is better a great deal that a man ſhould lay out much for God then a little. God wil make good al that faith that you have had in him for the publique good: If you ſhould looſe what men have promiſed you, yet ſo far as it was for his name ſake, God wil become a debtor to you, and pay you wel. And I look upon the times when I heare men complain, Truly I cannot tel how better to compare it, Then as if an heire ſhould grievouſly complaine that he is put to charges to take up the poſſeſſion of his great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, Or as if a man ſhould complain that hath laid out al the mony in his purſe, when he hath good commodities in the roome of it. God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to give you what you have fought and prayed for. And let me ſay thus much, that though ſome men cry out Perſecution, Perſecution: Yet is it any perſecution for the ſervants to take their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? Is it any perſecution to cal upon you for that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:159991:140"/>which may prevent them that would bring about a warr, and to keep thoſe beaſts that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure from being able to break in upon you? Is it perſecution for men to ſit under their own vines, and eate the fruit of their own fig trees, In their houſes, and be quiet, and none to make afraid? Is this perſecution? for men to be free from oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to be called upon for nothing, but that which is for publique uſe and charge? Is this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution? When men have no enemies, but becauſe themſelves would be great, and over al, and are not ſatisfied? Is this perſecution? Conferre with the primitive times, and tel them you are under perſecution, Such as they never felt: for you dwel at peace, and none moleſt you; you are at a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter allowance and maintenance then many have heretofore had for more work. What rate would men have given ſome yeares agone for that which they now do injoy. It is not therefore any juſt reaſon that men have to complain thus, but only through the wretchedneſs of mens hearts, who are alſo unſatisfyed becauſe they know not wel what they would have, therefore it is, that there are ſuch complaining in the ſtreets. It is not from perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but from Covetouſneſs, becauſe men have not al they would have. The great ſin of al is Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, becauſe men are drawn nearer to the world and to themſelves. Men think al diſſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the world, to be but an art to keep men from their good. When Miniſters dehort from loving the world, Men think it is that al may come to them. It is not unlawful to take for that which a man lends for the preſervation of the publique, no more then it is for a Labourer to take mony for making a fort to preſerve it. But Covetouſneſs in ſome men makes them take mony of others who had it for their own preſervation. I beſeech you
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:159991:140"/>my beloved, Cure but your hearts of this diſtemper of Covetouſneſs and ſelf ſeeking: Seek nor great things, but juſt and righteous ones for your ſelves: ſet a price upon them, And then you wil find that there is neither too much ſpent, ſo far as hath been laid out and imployed that way, Nor is there any hard dealing with you to cal for more, that that which is got may be preſerved. I thought to ſpeak of this by the way, becauſe that Covetouſneſs is the great underminer of States, Eſpecially in the change of things: It is that which doth give away what God hath purchaſed for a man at a deare rate, rather then he wil be at the charge to keep it. The Times have brought forth this Man-child viz free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from thoſe that did labour to deſtroy and ruine you: Now my beloved let there be nothing wanting. When Ireland calls upon you, that you would help them, diſtribute freely: when as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this nation calls upon you to releive it, Give it as freely: Why? becauſe you muſt beware of Covetouſneſs, And it is Covetouſneſs for a man not to lay out what ever he hath for God, to the uſes which God calls it for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Is a man to reſerve nothing for himſelf.</p>
               <p>That I wil anſwer afterwards when I come to the Caſes of this point. This is certaine, That a publique good is to be preſerved before a private: And your happineſs is more in doing good to a Kingdom then in providing for your own Families. You get more your ſelves. For if there be a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of much good, there ſhal be an offering up on your behalf many prayers, and thoſe God wil heare A man had better be rich in prayers, then rich in Jewels. He doth more for a man that prays to God to take care for him, then he doth for himſelf
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:159991:141"/>that keeps thouſands. Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs. When God hath ſaved you ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly, ſuffer not your ſelves to be deſtroyed by a baſe luſt. When you have given ſo freely before for liberty and freedom, do not looſe it for a penny more. He is a fool that comes to buy a Commodity, that wil not give a penny more for it, if he need it. You may as wel be deſtroyers of the nation, by not giving your help at the laſt, as you would have been, if you had held your hands in your boſomes, and not have given at the firſt. There is a great ſpeech of Malignity in the world, But this is the greateſt, for to looſe that which you may eaſily have, not to fight for that which was ſo hard to get: I may ſay of Covetouſneſs when I come to the ſinews of it, that it wil lay a taxe and charge upon al the world. Few men wil be free. Go to the State, and Army, to Godly men, and Trades men, of al ſorts and conditions, ſtil you wil find this ſin he grubbing, and like a Pyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer digging at the root in mens ſpirits, that it may firſt or laſt rob a man of the Injoyment of God at the leaſt, if it doth not do him an il turne at the preſent in this life.</p>

Its a ſin that blinds the Judgment, As gifts blind the eyes of the wiſe. It is a more then ordinary crafty and deceitful ſin. Therefore they are called deceitful riches. In <hi>'Mark.</hi> 4.19. And it is uſed in the Similitude of care, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and faithfulneſs to the opportunities God puts into a mans hands. It is a ſpiritual ſin, born in the heart, And may live there without breaking forth into any external evil Acts. As hypocriſy is hard to be diſcovered, becauſe it is between God and a mans own ſoul: So is Covetouſneſs, becauſe it may be, and yet no external evil act done: For it lyes in an inordinate deſire. A man may do al that is good, he may neglect no duty of Religion, nor tranſgreſs any Law of Juſtice in his calling, and yet notwiſtanding be Covetous. Therefore in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. He diſtinguiſheth Covetouſneſs from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, or unjuſt gaine. It is a ſin that lyes ſo near the borders of Duty, that as two colours alike or
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:159991:142"/>two perſons are hard to be known, So its a hard thing for a man to diſtinguiſh between Care, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Faithfulneſs and Covetouſneſs. It is a ſin which lyes in the meaſure of the act, and not in the act it ſelf. It is lawful to deſire riches, but ſo to deſire them, as not to be ſatisfied with what God gives, make it a ſin. To ſhew how hard it is to be diſcerned. Conſider,</p>
               <p>A man may do an act that may ſeem to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Covetouſneſs, and yet be Covetous</p>
               <p>There are two acts of Covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p>One is, deſiring more then a man hath.</p>
               <p>The other is, Retayning that which a man hath and not laying it out to the uſes which God aſſigns them. Now a man may be free from Covetouſneſs in the one, and yet not in the other. A man may not keep that which he hath, and yet be covetous in deſiring to have that which he hath not. For a man to deſire ſuch a ſtock to the end that he may do good unto others, is Covetouſneſs: And yet that end ſeems to be againſt Covetouſneſs. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs wil put a neceſſity upon earthly things for ſpiritual ends. Earthly things cannot be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ends. Riches are profitable and neceſſary only in a degree, in regard of external circumſtance. As if a man think he cannot carry himſelf as a member of Chriſt, nor do as religion requires of him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an eſtate; He is guilty before God. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are good, But if you muſt have them or elſe you die, you over love them. So if you think you muſt have riches or elſe you cannot walk with God as you ſhould do, you fal into Covetouſneſs: which is a great ſin. for it makes the ſervice of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon things which are of common diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>Again: When a man doth Duties of Religion to get places of gain or Loaves, or bleſſings from God. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>They come before me and ſeem to be as my people, but their hearts run after their Covetouſneſs.</hi> There is difference between a wordly thought in a mans mind in Duty and making the world his end. He that makes the world his end, is Covetous. Though he makes it not his laſt end, yet if he ſets it in an higher place than thoſe that are ſubordinate to God himſelf. God wil allow a man to look to himſelf, but after God: But the laſt thing that a man is to take care for, is for the things of this life.</p>
               <p>Again: Covetouſneſs is not mortified when other Luſts are not. All Luſts do live and die together. In <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.5. where he bids them to mortifie Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, he bids them to mortifie inordinate affections and evil concupiſcence, &amp;c. Inordinate affections belong unto the Iraſcible paſſions or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, by which we oppoſe evil. And evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence belongs to the other faculties, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the things of a mans good. Now theſe take up a mans whole Soul: But if theſe two be not in order, Covetouſneſs is not mortified. The Luſt of the eye is the Steward which provides for the luſt of the Fleſh, and the pride of life. If you wil pluck up Covetouſneſs, you muſt dig up the whole heart, mortifie all Corruptions. If any be left, this will grow with it</p>
               <p>But in Particular. When a man hath a quick and a large underſtanding, apprehenſion, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the matters of this life, but to the diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſpiritual things is dul. When a man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:159991:143"/>and ſharp in underſtanding the things of this life, but is really dul unto ſpiritual things, A man is then Covetous. And the reaſon is this. Becauſe the ground why a mans knowledg is more excellent in one thing than in another, and why he is more attentive to know one thing more than another, is, becauſe his affections are to one thing more than another. Therefore if a man be quick in the things of this life, and dul in the things of God, he is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous. The worldly man is deſcribed by the Cares of this life which choak the word. When a man is truly dul; I ſay not when he is ſo in his own Judgment. As the wiſeſt men think they err in wiſdom, As a Sea-man thinks no horſes goe faſt, becauſe they go not ſo faſt as a Ship: So a wiſe man in ſpiritual things thinks himſelf a Fool. In <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.2. He ſaith <hi>He had not the underſtanding of a man.</hi> He ſpake of things beyond a mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and yet he ſaith of himſelf. A man may be dul in his own apprehenſion, and yet not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
               <p>Again: The time muſt be conſidered, and the means which we have had to make them underſtand the matters of Godlineſs. If a man have lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a rational and ſcripture teaching Miniſtry, and have had a long time of it, and yet is dul in the things of God, and is grown wiſe in the things of the world: It is a great ſign that a mans care is for the things of this life, and not for the things of God.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>A man may have larger parts than Grace, therefore a man may be wiſer in the things of this world than in the things of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That is without controverſie. Yet Grace ſets a mans mind ſo upon ſpiritual things that a
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:159991:144"/>mans parts are ſet upon the things of God, and they die unto the things of the world. Diligence will make up and repair a mans parts: And Grace makes a man diligent. I ſpeak of real dulneſs. When a man is not dul in one paint of Religion, but in al: not only dul under one Miniſtry, but under all. I not when a man is heard to come to knowledg: For men that come hardlieſt by knowledg, when they have it, do keep it longeſt. And do you Judg of this Particular. If your ſtrength lies in the things of this world, that you are exquiſite there, that you can go through all the turnings of this life, and do any thing in the buſineſs of this life, but in the things of God you ſpeak notionally, and not ſpiritually, as one that heard the ſtory, and not as one that knows the things, then you are Covetous.</p>
               <p>Again: See how it is with you when God cals you to part with all. Men are ſuch as they are, when they are tryed. Nothing tries mens affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to a thing ſo much, as parting with it. When things do come in competition, and a man cannot have both, he wil then take that which he loves. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> commands the Child to be cut in pieces, becauſe motherly affections would appear. Somtimes God threatens to take al: And ſomtimes God takes all. And ſomtimes a man is in his ſpirit as if he ſhould loſe all. What are your hearts then? In 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 10, 11. it is ſaid when <hi>Paul</hi> was ready to be offered up, that <hi>Demas</hi> did forſake him, and did cleave unto this preſent world. His heart was in the world, becauſe he did for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his eſtate, forſake and leave <hi>Paul.</hi> To open that place.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>It may be ſaid that</hi> Demas <hi>did ſuffer Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, for he was with</hi> Paul <hi>in his impriſonment,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:159991:144"/>and</hi> Paul <hi>recommended him unto</hi> Philemon, <hi>and unto the Church of</hi> Coloſſe. <hi>Every one of the grounds by which the ſeverall ſorts of hearers are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood do go beyond one another. The High way ground doth give the word the hearing; but repeats it not, meditates not of it, remembers it not, but the ſtony ground went further, and they did ſo, but they thought the word of God dot worthy enduring the troules that it brought, but the thorny ground, the Covetous groud that came under Perſecution: Now how can it be a ſign of Covetouſneſs if they endure Perſecution? This is the Objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt the meaning is not, that they will endure any kind of Perſecution, but ſuch Perſecution as is againſt the plain and cleer points of Religion. For that which the High-way ground regards not, the Principles of Godlineſs, that the other grounds ſuffered for, and ſtood to. But thoſe were the Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, converting points, for the Text in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. ſpeaks of converting points of Religion, Such points which diſtinguiſh regeneracy and unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. One ſort of people minded not theſe things: The other rather ſuffered for them, than that they would part with them. Rather than <hi>Demas</hi> would ſay the Goſpel was a lie, and that Jeſus Chriſt was not God, he would die preſently: That was ſo rooted in his Conſcience that he would have thought himſelf unhappy to have given any check to it. They did not come down right upon him, but by cunning waies, the Devil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>kes men by craſt and not by fair ſtrength. However <hi>Demas</hi> did not love his life in this Caſe, yet he loved his riches bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his life. He cries better live not, and be not, than be in want. When he was with <hi>Paul,</hi> there was no great hazard run, for it is ſaid that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:159991:145"/>
                  <hi>Oneſiphorus</hi> enquired him out, and was not aſhamed to walk with <hi>Paul</hi> when he had chains about him. Now if men might go to men in Priſon, and walk up &amp; down with them in the ſtreets, there was not much hazard and danger. That <hi>Demas</hi> could bear. But when he muſt part with all, the Text ſaith, <hi>He cleaves to this preſent world</hi> That is, ſuch a kind of cleaving as is in the heart of God unto Chriſt and his people: for by that word the heart of God is ſet out in the Scripture. It ſignifies content, and reſt, and ful delight and ſatisfaction in a thing. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> his heart was thus ſwallowed up in the things of this life. And therefore though he could have loſt his life at the firſt rather than to have denied the Principles of Religion, yet he would rather have loſt his life than endured want. If when God cals for all, you would ſpare ſome, you are Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous. And ſay not that great degrees of Grace is required unto this, for when the wil of God is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and determinately known, a Saint ſits down under it and quels al motions againſt it. When a Godly man ſees God wil have al, he ſaith, Thy wil be done.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially is a Godly man ready in the things of this life. becauſe at Converſion there is a mean eſteem in him of the things of this life: he looks not for things that are temporal, but for what is eternal. It is in the nature of a Beaſt to look after graſs, and the fields, to live in the Air: So for a Chriſtian to have a mean eſteem of this world, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his end, or means: He ſlights it for means, and deſpiſeth it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his ends. Look what you are when God takes away the things of this world? Are your hearts in a quietneſs and compoſedneſs?</p>
               <p>Again: A man is then Covetous when he takes al opportunities of getting.</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:159991:145"/>
               <p>Again: When a man is having and craving in his ſpirit, when his praiers ſavors of the world, like a vapor out of a Dungeon; when his affections are ſtrong in the matters of this life. A mans Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is not cured, when his deſires are hot.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Is it not lawfull for a man to deſire more than he hath, or ſo much as may Act all his parts and abilities in him? Whether a mans obſerving what abilities he hath for publique ſervice, may not deſire ſuch a portion of this life, as may Act him therein?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Oftentimes it is not ſo much the love of a mans work as the love of a mans waies. A man thinks he deſires to love God when he loves the world.</p>
               <p>The world is not worth the having. You are in the world for Heaven. When your thoughts are bowed down, be afraid of that: Trade not with thoſe thoughts. Remember Chriſts words, Take heed and beware of Covetouſneſs: Ariſe ye dead and come to Judgment. There is a Snare in your Calling, you may be Covetous in deſiring nothing but your due, As this young man in my Text.</p>
